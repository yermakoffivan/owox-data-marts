- 03172e5: # Fix: "Copy from..." no longer shares or deletes another Data Mart's credentials

  Using "Copy from..." to reuse a connector configuration from another Data Mart
  made both Data Marts point at the same stored credentials instead of copying
  the values. Saving the new Data Mart could then delete those shared
  credentials, wiping them on both.

  Copying a configuration that holds manually entered credentials now always
  creates its own credentials record, and a Data Mart can no longer write to or
  delete credentials that belong to another one. Data Marts that already share a
  record are separated automatically the next time each of them is saved.

  A few details worth knowing:
  - Connections authorized through OAuth are still shared between Data Marts, as
    they were before — such a credential belongs to the project rather than to a
    single Data Mart.
  - Credentials already wiped by this bug are not restored; those Data Marts need
    their credentials entered again.
  - A copied Microsoft Ads configuration starts from the source's current
    (rotated) refresh token, so the copy keeps working even when the originally
    entered token has already expired. From there each Data Mart rotates its own
    token independently.
  - Deleting a Data Mart no longer removes credentials that another Data Mart
    still references: the record is handed over to the referencing Data Mart
    instead, so a not-yet-separated pair cannot lose data through deletion.
  - Copying a configuration with "Copy from…" now requires edit access to the
    source Data Mart for every connector: you must be its technical owner, or it
    must be shared with you for maintenance.

- a30ab25: # Plugin collections: host-stored JSON documents for installed plugins

  Plugins can declare project- or member-scoped collections in `plugin.json` and access them through `ctx.collections(name)`. The host persists JSON documents, applies the collection's entity authorization rules, and keeps credentials out of the plugin frame.

  The SDK collection facade supports paginated `list`, nullable `get`, `put`, and `delete` operations. Entity-bound writes include an immutable `parentId`, allowing the host to authorize every operation against the current member's access to the parent entity.

- 46a39ea: # Connectors use supported API versions

  Previously, the Google Ads connector called API version v21, which Google
  sunset on 2026-08-05, causing every import to fail with an
  `UNSUPPORTED_VERSION` error. The LinkedIn Ads and LinkedIn Pages connectors
  were also close to hitting the same wall: they called a version only two
  months newer than one LinkedIn had already sunset. The Shopify connector was
  two releases behind, with its version nearing its own support cutoff.

  Now, Google Ads uses v25, LinkedIn Ads and LinkedIn Pages use the 2026-07
  version, and Shopify uses the 2026-07 version — all current, supported
  releases. This means imports for these connectors keep running instead of
  failing once their old versions are sunset.

- 43a54e6: # Google Ads campaign and video metrics import

  Google Ads renamed four fields in its v25 API — `video_views`, `video_view_rate`, `campaign_start_date`, and `campaign_end_date` — and the connector kept requesting the old names. Because Google Ads rejects a query entirely when it contains even one unrecognized field, any `campaigns` or `campaigns_stats` import selecting one of these failed outright, including new data marts, which select the campaign dates by default.

  The connector now requests Google Ads' current field names, so these imports run again. No action is needed: the fields keep the same names in OWOX, and existing data mart configurations and destination tables are unaffected.

- 24932f6: # AI helper failures are now visible and understandable instead of silently disappearing

  During AI metadata generation for SQL-based data marts, a missing BigQuery permission (`bigquery.datasets.create`, required by the technical-view flow) failed the run before the AI step — and the error toast auto-dismissed in seconds, so users never learned why nothing was generated. This release improves the communication around such failures without changing the technical-view creation logic itself:
  - Generation errors now show as persistent, dismissible notifications instead of an auto-dismissing toast; leaving the page mid-generation leaves a notice that the run was cancelled.
  - BigQuery permission errors are rewritten into a human-readable message naming the project and the missing permission, with the raw error expandable for support.
  - AI helper trigger logs now include `dataMartId` and `projectId`, and the AI insights facade logs the caught error for failed metadata generation, so production incidents can be found by filtering logs on the data mart id.

- e387fee: # Include field descriptions in the Models canvas exports

  The Models canvas export dropped the business descriptions of Output Schema fields: in the OKF bundle the schema table's Description column carried only the PK/FK notes, and the JSON model graph omitted the field descriptions entirely.

  Both formats now carry each field's description as stored in the Data Mart:
  - **OKF (Markdown)** — the Description cell reads `PK.` → description. Multi-line descriptions collapse to a single line so they cannot break the Markdown table. The `FK to [Target]` notes left the schema table entirely: relationships live only in the Joins section, which already lists every join with its condition.
  - **JSON** — every schema field gains a `description` property when one is set, staying compatible with the OWOX Model Canvas graph format.

- e387fee: Ask the AI assistant to present the MCP `data_last_updated` timestamp in a business-friendly form (e.g. "August 4, 2026 at 09:46 UTC", converted to the user's time zone when known) instead of echoing the raw ISO-8601 value. The structured response still carries the ISO-8601 timestamp for machines.
- e387fee: # Joinable Data Marts: filters on the toolbar, applied to both List and Graph

  The **Status** and **looped data marts** filters of the Joinable Data Marts block moved out of the diagram's gear popover onto the toolbar, right next to search — the same place the Models canvas keeps its filters. They are now dropdowns (`All statuses` / `Published only` / `Draft only`, and `Hide looped data marts` / `Show looped data marts`).

  More importantly, the filters now cover **both views**: previously they only trimmed the Graph, so switching to List silently showed a different set of relationships. The List now applies the same rules as the diagram — including subtree semantics, where hiding a data mart also hides everything joined through it. Saved filter preferences carry over unchanged.

- e387fee: # api-client: expose `in`/`not_in` filters and the new relative-date presets in the traversal types

  Release 0.31.0 taught the Data Mart traversal API the `in`/`not_in` operators and the `this_week`/`last_week`/`this_quarter`/`last_quarter`/`next_n_days` relative-date presets, but the public `@owox/api-client` types were not updated: a TypeScript caller writing `operator: 'in'` got a compile error even though the request itself works.
  - `TraverseDataFilterRule` gains the `in`/`not_in` branch: `value` is an **array** of 1..500 same-type values (all strings or all numbers) — never a comma-separated string, and never booleans (use `is_true`/`is_false`).
  - `TraverseDataRelativeDatePreset` gains `this_week`, `last_week`, `this_quarter`, `last_quarter`, and `next_n_days`.
  - The `@owox/api-client` guide now documents every filter operator's `value` shape (scalar / array / `{ from, to }` / preset), the `in`/`not_in` constraints, the full relative-date preset list, and the NULL-inclusive semantics of negative operators; the OpenAPI description of the `filter` query parameter shows an `in` example.

- e387fee: # Joinable Data Marts diagram: the same view settings as the Models canvas

  The gear on the Joinable Data Marts diagram is back — and it now holds the same view settings as the Models canvas, shared component and all:
  - **View** — switch cards between **Compact** and **Detailed**; Detailed shows the joined mart's field rows (name + type, hidden-for-reporting fields dimmed), collapsed to 4 rows with an in-place "+N more" toggle.
  - **Layout algorithm** — **Horizontal** or **Vertical**; the diagram now uses the same dagre layout engine as the Models canvas.
  - **Show join fields** — join conditions (`source = target`) rendered as labels on the relationship lines.
  - **Object labels** — toggle the input-source badge and accent stripe, the field count, and the status dot per card, with "Check all" / "Uncheck all" shortcuts.

  All settings are remembered per browser, and the inline and fullscreen diagrams stay in sync.

- e387fee: # Typing in the SQL editor now works reliably on connected Data Marts

  On Data Marts joined with other Data Marts, the SQL Query editor could refuse to insert spaces: you would type `select * from`, press the spacebar, and nothing would appear. This happened whenever the Joinable Data Marts section was set to the diagram view — the diagram was silently capturing the spacebar for itself. The editor now always receives everything you type, regardless of how the Joinable Data Marts section is displayed.

  Two more editing annoyances are gone as well:
  - A query you were still writing no longer disappears when the page refreshes its data in the background (for example, right after saving, publishing, or updating the output schema).
  - After picking a different input source type, the Save button no longer stays greyed out while a valid query is on screen.

- 58d4891: # Connecting a Google account no longer fails intermittently

  Authorizing Google BigQuery storage or a Google Sheets destination could fail at random — the popup would show a sign-in screen or an authorization error, and the connection would only succeed after several attempts.

  The cause: the OAuth popup used to boot the entire application and sign in on its own. That sign-in competed with the main tab for the same single-use session credentials, and whichever window lost the race failed. The popup could also end up in a different project context than the tab that started the connection, which made the authorization attempt be rejected.

  Now the popup only hands the authorization result back to the tab where you clicked "Connect with Google", and that tab completes the connection using its own session. One attempt is all it takes.

- ec28b5e: # API surface maintenance

  ## Low-level API client transport methods

  OWOX API clients can now use `patchJson()` and `deleteJson()` alongside
  `getJson()`, `postJson()`, `putJson()`, and `getStream()` for `/api/...`
  endpoints that do not yet have typed resource abstractions. Authenticated
  low-level requests accept only root-relative `/api/...` paths up to 2,048
  characters and refuse unsafe paths and redirects, preventing credentials from
  being sent to an unintended destination. Existing custom transports remain
  source-compatible and can add PATCH and DELETE support independently; calling
  an unsupported new method rejects with `OWOXConfigError`.

  The existing plugin protocol adds PATCH and DELETE through `ctx.owox` as an
  additive capability while preserving compatibility with existing plugins.
  Low-level JSON return values are caller-typed and are not runtime-validated;
  consumers should prefer typed resource abstractions when available.

  ## Manage Data Mart run lifecycles through the API client

  `@owox/api-client` now supports starting, listing, inspecting, and cancelling Data Mart runs through
  the Data-Mart-scoped `runs.forDataMart(id)` client and its `start()`, `list()`, `get()`, and `cancel()`
  methods. Starting and cancelling require Technical User access; listing and inspecting require
  Business User access. `start()` accepts typed incremental or manual-backfill options, including
  connector-specific fields. Manual-backfill `data` is optional for connectors without backfill
  fields. The API client requires an explicit `MANUAL_BACKFILL` run type whenever `data` is supplied
  and rejects `data` on implicit or explicit incremental runs before sending a request. The backend
  HTTP endpoint separately accepts retained object-valued `data` on incremental requests so existing
  run forms remain compatible. The client also rejects empty, dot-segment, or separator-bearing Data
  Mart and run IDs before sending a request. Serialized manual-run options are limited to 1 MiB by
  both the client and HTTP API; requests above the HTTP transport ceiling return `413` instead of an
  internal-server error. Packaged authentication middleware now limits its body parsers to `/auth`,
  so it no longer overrides the backend API's 2 MiB transport ceiling.

  Scoped list pagination defaults to 100 items when omitted and preserves valid caller-provided limits
  and offsets without silently capping them. The scoped list method rejects unknown, zero or negative
  limits, negative offsets, non-integer values, non-finite values, and integers outside JavaScript's
  safe range before authentication or network access. Project-wide `runs.list()` pagination remains
  unchanged and relies on server normalization.
  Project-wide and Data-Mart-scoped run methods remain compatible with older self-hosted deployments
  that omit Data Quality fields, and Data Quality response validation tolerates additive server fields
  while still checking known values. Existing typed integrations need no migration.

- 0301c9e: # Add direct Google Chat delivery while preserving channel email

  Google Chat Destinations now offer Incoming Webhook and Channel Email delivery methods. Existing
  email-based destinations keep their current method, while new destinations default to direct
  delivery through a space-specific incoming webhook. Webhook messages are formatted cards containing
  the subject, Data Mart name, rendered report, and a link back to OWOX Data Marts.

### Minor Changes 0.31.0

![OWOX Data Marts – v0.30.0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a994aa1a-554a-4475-aa53-94369f8429e7)

- 61fc1bc: **Add Data Quality checks**

  Configurable manual and scheduled Data Quality runs for BigQuery, Legacy BigQuery, Athena, Snowflake, Redshift, and Databricks Data Marts. The new Data Quality workspace supports 11 table, field, and relationship checks, stores reproducible SQL and examples, and surfaces compact results in Output Schema, Models, and Run History.

- e8ae62c: **Data Last Updated Date**

  You can now see when the source tables behind a Data Mart last changed in the warehouse — in the UI and through MCP.
  - **In the UI** — the Data Mart page shows a **Data Last Updated** tile with a **Check now** button, the Data Marts list gains a sortable **Data Last Updated** column, and the model canvas shows the value on every node with an **Actions → Check Data Last Updated** entry that measures everything currently visible in one go. Checking reads warehouse metadata only: it registers no consumption and records no run.
  - **In MCP** — `query_data_mart` returns a `data_last_updated` block alongside the rows and totals, reporting when the source tables behind the result last changed, which tables were checked, and how complete that picture is. It is measured live as part of the same call — never cached, never charged separately — and against the fully composed query, so a blended result covers every joined Data Mart's tables, not just the primary one. Each MCP query run also records the block in Run History.
  - **On every run** — every run that delivers data measures the value on the way out: report runs (manual and scheduled), HTTP Data requests, and MCP queries all record it in Run History. When a run reads only the Data Mart's own sources, the measurement also becomes the Data Mart's saved value, so the list, canvas, and Data Mart page stay current without anyone pressing a button. A run spanning several joined Data Marts records the measurement in its history entry only, because a blended reading would overstate any single Data Mart.

  Google BigQuery is supported first: `TABLE`, `VIEW`, `SQL`, `TABLE_PATTERN`, and connector-backed Data Marts all resolve through to their underlying base tables, including nested views and sharded/wildcard table sets. Other storages report `unavailable` until their support lands.

  Read the timestamp precisely: it says when the source tables were last **written to**, not which period the data covers — which is why the field is called _data last updated_ rather than _freshness_, and the tool instructs the assistant to phrase it that way. A `null` timestamp means unknown, neither fresh nor stale; `coverage: "partial"` means some sources could not be read, so the real time can only be more recent than reported. Views are excluded from the per-table detail, because a view's modification time reflects a change to its definition rather than to any data.

- db60962: **Google Sheets source connector**

  A new Google Sheets source connector imports one sheet into a table in the user's Storage and makes it available as a Data Mart. It supports Service Account authentication, dynamic header-based field inference, and full refreshes across supported storages, so the materialized table reflects the current sheet contents, including schema changes.

- c6c0d7b: **Models canvas redesigned as an ERD, Joinable Data Marts diagram to match**

  The Data Marts **Models** canvas now renders ERD cards instead of plain title boxes. Each card shows a definition-type badge and accent color (`SQL` / `View` / `Table` / `Pattern` / `Connector`), a published/draft status dot, and — in the new **Detailed** view — typed field rows with a primary-key indicator, primary keys first, and hidden-for-reporting fields dimmed. Long field lists collapse to 4 rows with an in-place "+N more fields" toggle. Switch between **Compact** (default) and **Detailed** in the canvas settings; the choice is remembered per browser.

  Cards are draggable and their positions persist per storage in your browser across reloads (picking a layout algorithm re-flows from scratch). A new **Object labels** setting toggles what every card shows — input-source badge, field count, status dot — with "Check all" / "Uncheck all" shortcuts. Relationship lines are smooth bezier curves, neutral gray at rest and brand-blue when selected: click a single line, or click a card to light up all of its connections. The minimap colors nodes by definition type. The canvas renders immediately from the list data and enriches cards with fields as details load, so large models appear without delay.

  The **Joinable Data Marts** diagram on the Data Mart page uses the same ERD card design, and its gear popover gains two filters: **Show looped Data Marts** (off by default — self-referencing loop stubs no longer blow up the graph) and a **Status** filter (All / Published / Draft).

  Thanks to @ikrasovytskyi for contributing the redesign!

- be313d1: **Export the Models canvas as SVG, PNG, JSON, or an OKF bundle**

  The Models canvas now exports the data model through **Actions → Export**, in four formats:
  - **Image (SVG)** — a vector snapshot of the whole visible model, crisp at any zoom.
  - **Image (PNG)** — the same snapshot rasterized at 2× scale, for chats and tools that do not render SVG.
  - **JSON** — the model graph (Data Marts, schemas, joins, canvas positions) in the OWOX Model Canvas format, sanitized of project identifiers.
  - **OKF (Markdown)** — a zip with one cross-linked Markdown document per Data Mart plus an index: an overview, the schema table, and the join list per mart. Works well as context for AI assistants.

  The export covers exactly what the canvas shows — the same filtered set the other Actions target — and captures the whole model regardless of the current pan and zoom. Image backgrounds follow the active theme, so dark-theme exports stay readable outside the app.

  The canvas also got leaner: the **Actions** menu moved from a canvas overlay into the toolbar above the canvas, so it no longer covers content; the field count now shares a row with the Data Quality and Data Last Updated indicators, making every card one row shorter; and the Object labels settings list dropped its decorative glyphs.

- 398e908: **Plugin Gallery: publish, install and run plugins described by GitHub releases**

  Plugins are web apps hosted elsewhere, described by a GitHub repository's releases, listed in a per-member Gallery and opened inside OWOX Data Marts in a sandboxed cross-origin iframe. A plugin holds no credential of its own: it can only ask the host page to make calls the host has already decided are allowed, acting with the authority of the member who installed it.
  - **Publishing and installing are separate.** A publication controls what a member sees in the Gallery, at three independent levels — deployment, project and member — combined into one deduplicated list with no precedence between them. Installing is each member's own decision, uninstalling is soft, and a previous installer can restore from history even after the plugin stops being published to them. Unpublishing removes a listing without uninstalling anyone.
  - **Updates are managed by the deployment, daily.** Every published or installed plugin is checked once a day for a newer valid release, each at its own time of day. When a check finds a valid higher version it becomes current for everyone using that plugin — versions cannot be pinned, chosen or rolled back, and the plugin page says so along with when the next check happens. **Check now** brings that check forward for anyone who can reach the page; it never decides whether an update happens. A failed check leaves the working version active until the next daily slot.
  - **Plugin identity is the GitHub repository**, held by its stable numeric id, so renaming or transferring a repository resolves to the same plugin. Versions are immutable and anchored to an exact commit: moving, deleting or recreating a tag cannot rewrite an existing version, and an invalid release never displaces a working one.
  - **Emergency control.** An allowlisted publisher key can suspend a plugin across the deployment. Suspension blocks opening, installing and restoring while leaving uninstalling and update checking available, so a corrective version can still become current before the plugin is resumed. It changes no publication or installation record.

  Plugin authors build against the new `@owox/plugin-sdk`, which owns the host handshake and hands the plugin a working OWOX Data Marts API client. `owox-ctl` gains `plugins publish`, `unpublish`, `publications list`, `update`, `suspend` and `resume`.

  New deployment variables: `OWOX_DEPLOYMENT_PLUGIN_PUBLISHER_API_KEY_IDS`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_APP_ID`, `GITHUB_APP_SLUG`, `GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY`, `GITHUB_API_BASE_URL`, `PLUGIN_HOST_SYNC_MIN_INTERVAL_SEC`, `PLUGIN_HOST_REMOTE_PROBE_TIMEOUT_MS`. The origin a vendor may name in `frame-ancestors` is the existing `PUBLIC_ORIGIN`, not a plugin-specific setting.

  **Behaviour change in `@owox/api-client`.** The package no longer depends on `undici`, so it can build for a browser and back a plugin's `ctx.owox`. As a result it no longer supplies a no-timeout dispatcher for streaming reads by default — pass one via the new `streamDispatcher` option if you call `traverseData` and need reads to run unbounded:

  ```ts
  new OWOXApiClient({ apiKey, streamDispatcher: new Agent({ bodyTimeout: 0, headersTimeout: 0 }) });
  ```

  `owox-ctl` does this already. `OWOXApiClient` additionally accepts `{ transport }` instead of `{ apiKey }`, which is how a plugin receives a working client while holding no credential of its own. Errors now carry the backend's stable machine-readable code, so a caller can branch on the failure instead of matching message text, and `error.details` carries the payload directly rather than the whole response body.

- 071b429: **Change the Input Source of an existing Data Mart**

  The Input Source type of a Data Mart can now be changed after setup — a table can become a SQL query, a view can be repointed at a real table, and so on, within the same storage. Previously the type was frozen once saved, so the only way to switch was to rebuild the Data Mart from scratch and recreate everything attached to it.

  The Data Mart keeps its identity through the change: relationships in both directions, reports and their column configuration, and field-level metadata such as aliases, descriptions and aggregation roles all stay in place. Fields missing from the new source are marked as disconnected and fields whose type changed are flagged, the same way they already are when a source of the same type is edited.

  Because a change can disconnect fields that reports and relationships rely on, it is confirmed in a dialog stating what is preserved, what may break, and how many relationships and reports depend on this Data Mart. A published Data Mart stays published. The new source is checked against the storage before the change is saved, so an unreachable table or an invalid query is refused instead of replacing a working definition and failing later. The schema is refreshed automatically right after the change, and refreshing the output schema now reports what it found — how many fields are connected, and how many came back disconnected or with a type mismatch — instead of only confirming that it ran.

  Data Marts based on a connector are not affected: their Input Source type stays fixed, and no other type can be switched to a connector.

- 66ac952: **HTTP Data on report level**

  Adds `GET /api/external/http-data/reports/{reportId}.ndjson` — stream an existing report's data as NDJSON, applying the report's saved filters, aggregations, date buckets, unique count, and sort, without reconstructing query parameters by hand. An optional `limit` query parameter overrides the report's saved limit. The [`@owox/api-client`](../../docs/api/api-client.md) `reports.traverseData()` method exposes the same endpoint.

  The response carries an `x-owox-run-id` header (consistent with the Data Mart HTTP Data endpoint); on a successful stream the referenced run is a `HTTP_DATA` run tagged with the reportId. When the report applies a filter, aggregation, sort, date bucket, row limit, or unique count — or blends fields across Data Marts — the run also records the exact executed SQL via `additionalParams.httpData.executionSqlQuery`, discoverable through the run history endpoint. (A plain column selection with none of those controls streams the Data Mart's own query and records no separate executed SQL.) Grand totals — one per selected metric, aggregated over the full result — are recorded in the run history whenever the report selects an eligible metric, computed as a separate best-effort query.

  Failed MCP `query_data_mart` calls create no run-history entry; both HTTP Data endpoints (Data Mart and report level) record a `FAILED` run for any failure encountered during query execution.

- ace4697: **Guide AI queries with a field type → operators/aggregations matrix**

  The MCP tools now tell an AI assistant up front which filter operators and aggregation functions each field supports, instead of letting it find out through failed queries:
  - `get_data_mart_details_by_id` enriches every native and joined field with its type `category` and the effective `allowedAggregations` a query may apply to it, and returns an `operators_by_category` matrix for the filter/slice operators each field-type category accepts.
  - The `query_data_mart` tool description embeds a field-type matrix generated from the same constants the validator enforces.
  - Operator/type mismatches (for example `contains` on a number) now return a targeted `invalid_operator_for_type` error listing the operators the field does accept, instead of a generic failure that sent assistants re-fetching the schema in a loop; `date_buckets` misuse gets equally specific `invalid_date_bucket` errors.
  - Boolean fields are now filterable: `eq`/`neq` with a boolean `true`/`false` value translate to the internal `is_true`/`is_false` operators.
  - New `in`/`not_in` filter operators (match any of / none of a value list, up to 500 values) are supported natively across BigQuery, Athena, Redshift, Snowflake, and Databricks. They are available in the report filter/slice UI as "is any of" / "is none of" (comma-separated values) for string, number, date, and time columns, and in `query_data_mart` filters/slices; `is_empty`/`is_not_empty` are now also accepted by `query_data_mart` for string fields.
  - Malformed operands for supported operators (empty `in` list, bad `between` shape) now return a precise `invalid_filter_value` error instead of a generic failure.
  - New relative-date presets on every storage, in the report UI, and in `query_data_mart`: **This week / Last week** (ISO weeks, Monday-based on all storages — BigQuery uses `ISOWEEK`, Snowflake computes the Monday independently of the session `WEEK_START`), **This quarter / Last quarter**, and **Next N days** (includes today, mirroring Last N days). With these, every operator advertised by `query_data_mart` is now executable — nothing maps to `unsupported_operator` anymore.

- edb1a40: **List draft Data Marts through MCP**

  MCP clients can now explicitly list draft Data Marts with `list_data_marts`, while published Data Marts remain the default catalog state.

- be2e29f: **Combined and Sample are now on by default for text fields**

  Text columns now offer `Combined` (`STRING_AGG`) and `Sample` (`ANY_VALUE`) out of the box, alongside `Count` and `Count Unique`. Previously both were supported but switched off, so you had to enable them field by field before a report could use them.

  Existing Data Marts pick this up automatically — a field only keeps a narrower list if you explicitly chose one for it. Numeric, date, time, boolean, and complex-type fields are unchanged, and neither function is ever included in Totals.

- 5e9b076: **Sort by Unique Count**

  Reports can now sort by the Unique Count metric. Previously, enabling Unique Count added the column to a report but the Sort section had no way to reference it. Once Unique Count is enabled, it now shows up as a sort option like any other column, ascending or descending.

- 04bf74d: **Joined field names read better in Google Sheets**

  Columns from a joined Data Mart used to lead with the Data Mart name — `RFM_SEGMENT Recency Score` — pushing the part you actually look for out of view in every header cell. Google Sheets now writes the Data Mart name after the field name, in parentheses: `Recency Score (RFM_SEGMENT)`. For a chain of joins the name is the Data Mart the field actually comes from, not the whole path. Fields from the report's own Data Mart are unchanged, and a blank Output Alias still produces a bare field name.

  Existing sheets pick the new headers up on their next refresh. Row 1 is rewritten in place — no column is added, removed or reordered, and nothing shifts under your own content to the right of the imported range.

  Data Studio, email-based destinations, the HTTP data endpoint and MCP field metadata keep the Data Mart name as a prefix — the position follows the surface that renders the label, not the report, so reading a Google Sheets report through the HTTP data endpoint still returns the prefixed form. Match columns on the technical field name, which is identical everywhere.

  Labels are also no longer padded: an Output Alias or field alias typed with a leading or trailing space used to leak that space into the column name, and a whitespace-only alias produced a column that looked unnamed. And a Google Sheets report that would write two columns under the same header now fails with a clear message naming the header, instead of writing the duplicate silently — previously the refresh after it blanked one column, inserted a spare, and pushed your own content further right. Rename one of the two columns, or the Output Alias of the joined Data Mart one of them comes from.

- ce982a5: **New Data Marts are shared for maintenance by default**

  A newly created Data Mart now starts with both sharing toggles on: **Shared for reporting** and **Shared for maintenance**. Other Technical Users can join it to their own Data Marts straight away, instead of first having to find the owner and ask them to share it.

  Data Marts that already exist are not changed. The owner can still turn **Shared for maintenance** off on any Data Mart in one click — non-owners then keep reporting access and lose the ability to edit or join it. Storages and Destinations keep their current defaults: shared for use, not shared for maintenance.

- 9e0434a: **Cleaner connector run logs: warnings for issues you can fix yourself**

  Failures now split into warnings and errors, so you can tell at a glance what needs you to act. Warnings mark issues you can fix yourself — like expired credentials or a canceled run. Errors mark issues our support team can help you resolve. Logs are also easier to scan: each crash appears as a single entry instead of several, and duplicate entries are gone.

- 562bbe2: **Clearer Data Warehouse selection during onboarding**

  The Data Warehouse step in onboarding now shows an interactive preview for the selected supported warehouse, illustrating how OWOX takes data from input sources, processes it in the chosen warehouse, and delivers it to destinations such as Google Sheets, Excel, email, Slack, and Looker Studio. The step also gains a responsive two-column layout, updated selection states, and a short animation. The preview is hidden when you select **Other** or **I don't know**.

- 5452659: **Copy a link to a Destination or Storage**

  Destinations and Storages now have a **Copy link** button in their configuration panel, so you can grab a direct link and share it with a teammate instead of explaining which item to click through the list to find.

- c97264b: **Easier access to service account details**

  When viewing Google service account credentials, you can now copy the service account email with one click or open its details in Google Cloud Console. The email remains visible and can still be selected manually when you only need part of it.

- 970bcee: **Correct COUNT DISTINCT, SUM, AVG, percentiles, and Combined across joined Data Marts (fan-out fix)**

  `COUNT DISTINCT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, the percentile metrics (`P25`, `Median`, `P75`, `P95`), and `Combined` on a joined Data Mart are now computed correctly at the report grain, including across multi-hop bridges (a joined Data Mart reached through another joined Data Mart). Previously each was pre-aggregated on the join key and then re-aggregated, which over- or under-counted (`COUNT DISTINCT`), over-summed (`SUM`), produced an unweighted average-of-averages (`AVG`), weighted a percentile by how many times the join repeated each value, or repeated the same text in `Combined` once per matching row, whenever the same entity was reachable through more than one path. Each metric now uses a dedicated "sleeve" pass that carries the raw identity to the report grain. These are symmetric (non-additive) aggregates: an entity reachable under two dimension values is counted once in each group but once overall, so a column's per-group values need not sum to its Totals value — that is correct, not a discrepancy. Applies to BigQuery, Athena, Redshift, Snowflake, and Databricks. **Numbers will change for any saved report using one of these metrics on a joined Data Mart whose join fans out.**
  - **Deduplication key.** For `SUM`, `AVG`, and the percentiles, the value is de-duplicated by the joined field's pre-join group key, or — when the field is a raw passthrough (pre-join `ANY_VALUE`) — by the joined Data Mart's own declared primary key. Two rows agreeing on that key and on the value are the same row the join returned twice and are counted once; two rows agreeing on the key but not on the value stay separate, so contradictory data is never silently resolved to one version. A joined Data Mart with no declared primary key falls back to a per-row surrogate, which cannot tell a genuine duplicate from two distinct rows. A declared key is trusted: a key that is not in fact unique will merge rows — and so will one whose column is empty on more than one row. Declare a key only on a column that is genuinely unique and always filled.
  - **`MIN` and `MAX`** on a joined Data Mart are computed the same way, over the same rows. They used to read the value the pre-join roll-up had already collapsed, which measured a different set from `AVG` on the very same column and could leave `MIN` above the average. **`COUNT` is deliberately unchanged**: it counts the rows that survive the join, which is a different question rather than a distorted one. The main-side Unique Count (by primary key) is unchanged.
  - **`COUNT` and `COUNT DISTINCT` are no longer shown side by side on a JOINED field.** They are computed at different grains, so together they can invert `COUNT DISTINCT <= COUNT`. **A report that selects both on a joined field now shows only `COUNT DISTINCT`** — the report is not rejected, and `COUNT` on its own keeps working exactly as before. Totals stop offering the pair for the same reason. A non-joined field is unaffected.
  - **Deterministic "any value" roll-up.** A joined field whose pre-join roll-up is "any value" is now rolled up deterministically. That roll-up is read twice — once for the report's grouping and again inside the fan-out correction — and an engine free to evaluate the two separately could return different values, which made the correction silently produce empty results. Applies to text, number, date and time fields; other types are unchanged.
  - **Joined `COUNT DISTINCT` on a pre-rolled-up field** (e.g. a text field pre-aggregated with `STRING_AGG` before the join) now counts distinct raw values at the report grain, not distinct rolled-up values. This is more correct — the previous behavior could conflate different raw values that rolled up into the same combined result — but the number can change for a saved report using such a field.
  - **Known limitation:** a metric (`HAVING`) filter on any of these joined metrics — `COUNT DISTINCT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `Combined`, or a percentile — is not yet supported and is rejected with a clear error; filter on a main-side column or a different metric instead. **A previously-saved report carrying such a filter will be rejected on its next run.**
  - **Totals now honour metric (`HAVING`) filters.** A Totals row has no grouping, so a per-group constraint used to be dropped, and Totals then summarised rows the report itself hides. Totals are now computed over the rows of the groups that pass the filter, and stay symmetric while doing so. **Totals will change for any saved report that carries a metric filter.**
  - **Totals that cannot be computed are now reported instead of silently omitted.** They are still best-effort — a failure never costs the query its rows — but an empty Totals block used to be indistinguishable from a report with no totals at all, which invites summing the returned rows instead (wrong for any non-additive metric). The reason travels with the response and is recorded in Run History; AI callers are told only that totals failed, since a warehouse message quotes the query and its table and column names.
  - **Incomplete or unusable relationships are rejected with an explanation** instead of failing at the warehouse. That covers a relationship saved with no join conditions (a supported draft state — it is refused when a report tries to use it, not when you save it), and one joining on a nested field such as `address.city`, which the query engine cannot express and which was previously accepted and then failed with a raw database error. Editing a relationship no longer requires filling in the join conditions, matching what creating one already allowed.
  - **Redshift identifier collisions are caught at save time.** Redshift lower-cases and truncates long identifiers, so two report columns differing only in case, or only past 127 bytes, arrive as one. Such a pair is now rejected when the report is saved, on every warehouse. **An already-saved report carrying such a pair is rejected on its next run** — on Redshift it was returning data from the wrong column.
  - **Reserved internal names.** A joined Data Mart with a source column named `__owox_rid`, or a report that groups by a field (or output alias) named `_oid`/`_oid_<n>`, `_oid_key_<n>`, `_val`/`_val_<n>`, or `_dedup` alongside a joined `SUM`/`AVG`/percentile metric, is now rejected with an error naming the column instead of silently returning a corrupted value — rename the field or its alias.
  - **Rejected requests now say what was actually wrong.** Every failed validation rule — across the whole API, not only reports — reached the caller as the single word "Bad Request Exception", with each per-field reason dropped before the response left the server. Each reason now travels with the response and is shown in the interface. A server error also shows a message identifying the request instead of failing silently.

- 2680781: **Keep NULL rows for "is not" / "is none of" / "does not contain" report filters**

  Negative filter operators (`is not`, `is none of`, `does not contain`, `does not match regex`) no longer drop rows where the filtered column is NULL. SQL three-valued logic previously excluded those rows; filters and slices now keep them so missing values behave like "not equal to X". Add `is not null` or `is not empty` when you want to exclude NULLs. Applies to BigQuery, Athena, Redshift, Snowflake, and Databricks.

  In blended reports this also changes post-join negative filters on `LEFT JOIN`ed columns: a filter like `crm.status is not Churned` now keeps source rows with no join match at all, where it previously acted as an implicit inner join. Add an `is not null` filter on the joined column to drop unmatched rows. Metric (`HAVING`) filters share the same logic, so a negative metric filter such as `SUM(amount) ≠ 0` now also keeps groups whose aggregate is NULL (e.g. all-NULL input).

- 122ce35: **More reliable connector runs during cancellation and long backfills**

  Previously, cancelling a connector run could fail to stick: the run reappeared as running minutes later, and its logs were lost. Long BigQuery backfills on OAuth also stopped after about an hour with an "Invalid Credentials" error. Now cancelled runs stay cancelled and keep their logs, and BigQuery refreshes its access token mid-run so long backfills continue.

  A run can still fail with "Invalid Credentials" if its saved token expired before the run started. Reconnect the BigQuery destination, or use a service account, until token saving arrives.

- 8724c41: **Fix dropped characters and lost focus in connector settings**

  Previously, typing into a field on the "Configure Settings" step dropped characters, so text seemed to appear only on the second try, and pasted values could revert. Credential fields also lost focus after the first character, forcing users to click back into the field. Both problems are fixed — fields now keep focus and accept every character, whether typed quickly or pasted.

  Nested credential fields now also show their readable labels everywhere. Some tabs previously showed the raw field name, such as "ServiceAccountKey" instead of "Service Account Key (JSON)".

- e02ff15: **Preview SQL no longer requires edit access**

  Opening **Preview SQL** on a report used to fail with "edit access to the source data mart is required" for anyone without maintenance access — including Business Users on a Data Mart shared for reporting, and Technical Users who are not owners of it. Reading the query a report runs is now tied to seeing the report: if a Data Mart is visible to you, you can open the generated SQL of any report on it and copy it to the clipboard.

  The two actions in that dialog that genuinely need maintenance access — the SQL validator (dry run) and **Copy as Data Mart** — are now hidden for users without it instead of failing on click. Reports that join a Data Mart the viewer cannot access still refuse to render SQL, naming the inaccessible Data Mart.

- e5d26a0: **No more leftover columns when switching Data Marts in Google Sheets**

  When creating a report in the Google Sheets extension, switching to another Data Mart now resets the column selection. Previously, columns picked for the first Data Mart stuck around and showed up as "Disconnected columns" under the new one — and could even reach the created report and make it fail.

- a54bf5d: **API surface maintenance**
  - **Project search API** — `GET /api/search` now publishes the integer range and comma-separated serialization of its optional filters in OpenAPI. `@owox/api-client` adds `search.query(query, options)` and exports `OWOXSearchResult`, `OWOXSearchEntityType`, and `OWOXSearchOptions` for discovering visible Data Marts, data storages, and data destinations. Existing viewer access and search behavior are unchanged.
  - **Project run history contract reconciled** — `GET /api/data-marts/runs` now publishes the complete project-wide run-history contract, including viewer visibility, pagination normalization, enums, field presence and nullability, and the backend's RFC3339 timestamp profile. `createdByUser` is the nullable run-author field; when present it includes `userId` and may include nullable `fullName`, `email`, and `avatar`. `definitionRun` remains present but can be `null` when a historical definition snapshot is unavailable. `@owox/api-client` validates this contract and exposes it as `runs.list({ limit, offset })` — **consumers using the previously released `runs.getHistory(...)` must rename those calls to `runs.list(...)`**; the response and option type exports remain available.
  - **HTTP Data streaming contracts strengthened** — `GET /api/external/http-data/data-marts/{dataMartId}.ndjson` now publishes its exact-column projection, bounded base64url controls, positive-integer limit, NDJSON response, run identifier, and failure contract in OpenAPI. `@owox/api-client` provides typed filter, sort, aggregation, and date-bucket controls for `dataMarts.traverseData(...)` and validates the NDJSON response media type before traversal. Consumers passing controls through `unknown[]` or widened variables must adopt the exported rule types or annotate their options with `TraverseDataOptions`; valid inline calls remain unchanged.
  - **Data Mart list contract actualized** — `GET /api/data-marts` now publishes viewer visibility, non-negative integer offset validation, owner-presence filtering, 1,000-item pages, and the complete nested list-item response contract, including nullable draft definition types and optional nullable user metadata strings. `@owox/api-client` validates every returned page and exposes the full `OWOXDataMart` shape; `dataMarts.list({ offset, ownerFilter })` can start from an offset, filter by `has_owners` or `no_owners`, and follows subsequent pages automatically. The package exports `OWOXDataMartListOptions`, `OWOXDataMartOwnerFilter`, and the nested Data Mart enum and object types, and rejects invalid list options before sending a request. Existing `dataMarts.list()` calls remain compatible.

- 86425d3: # More reliable MCP reporting answers

  MCP reporting tools now expose only published Data Marts and use clearer, business-friendly field labels in query results. Each result identifies its source Data Mart and includes OWOX links for the related Data Marts, reports, destinations, and schedules.

  When a query result is incomplete because of the row limit or response-size cap, the assistant receives an explicit truncation reason and instructions to make that limitation clear. It also receives guidance to use OWOX aggregations for count questions and to distinguish OWOX-calculated values from calculations made in the assistant response.

- cb6bc43: **Model canvas**

  New project-level, read-only visualization of the data marts visible to the user in a storage and their relationships, available from the new "Models" sidebar item under Data Marts. Includes filters by storage, status, and relationships; search with highlighting; join-field labels on edges; node-avoiding edge routing; selectable layout directions; and directional (including bidirectional) join edges. Both this canvas and the existing Joinable Data Marts graph are now rendered with React Flow (replacing Rete.js), preserving their established styling and interactions.

- f3a83b3: **Add project-based MCP server URLs**

  OWOX MCP now supports project-specific server URLs in the form `https://{projectId}.mcp.owox.com/mcp` alongside the existing shared `https://mcp.owox.com/mcp` server. Shared connections keep the existing project-selection flow. Project-specific connections derive the project from the MCP host, skip project selection, and still verify that the authenticated user has access to that project before issuing MCP tokens. Project settings show the project-specific MCP URL with copy support.

- 480e8bc: **Add project-aware MCP instructions**

  OWOX MCP servers now provide clients with built-in instructions for discovering and querying Data Marts with the current tool workflow. Project admins can add project-specific business context in Project settings; the project description is stored per project and appended to the MCP instructions when a client connects.

- 3a5abb3: **Create and update reports for every destination type through MCP**

  The `add_report` tool now supports all destination types, not just Google Sheets. Data Studio reports are created with default settings (a 5-minute data cache lifetime), and the response includes a setup-guide link — now also part of the `add_destination` response for `looker_studio`. Email, Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Google Chat reports take a new `message` parameter with the subject (defaults to the report name) and body template (supports the `{{table}}` placeholder); recipients stay on the destination and the send condition defaults to "Send always". `update_report` accepts the same `message` parameter to change the subject and/or body of an existing email-family report, preserving everything else including the send condition. Every `add_report` response now reports the `destination_type` it created.

- ba53b3a: **Create and update reports with query-parity output controls through MCP**

  The `add_report` tool accepts new optional `filters`, `slices`, `aggregations`, `date_buckets`, `sort`, and `limit` parameters — the same shape and vocabulary as `query_data_mart` — applied to the report on every run, so a filtered or aggregated query can be exported to a report that matches exactly the numbers the user saw. `update_report` accepts the same parameters as replacements (`[]` removes a control, `null` removes the row limit, omitting a parameter keeps the current value; `filters` and `slices` each replace only their own kind of rule). All controls work for every destination type and are validated against the data mart schema before any side effect — for Google Sheets, before the sheet document is created.

- 52b3245: **Sort rows from the `query_data_mart` MCP tool**

  `query_data_mart` now accepts a `sort` parameter — an ordered list of `{ field, direction }` rules (`asc`/`desc`, first rule primary) — so an assistant can order results (e.g. "top 10 campaigns by spend, descending") without post-processing. Each sorted field must also be listed in `fields`, matching the existing `aggregations` and `date_buckets` rules. This brings the MCP tool in line with sorting already available in the Reports, HTTP Data streaming, and CLI query paths.

- 2740556: **Improve Output Schema AI actions**

  The **Refresh schema** and global **Generate field aliases & descriptions** actions moved to the table toolbar, keeping all primary actions in one place. The global AI action dropdown was removed — a single click now generates both field aliases and descriptions. AI action buttons were added to the **Alias** and **Description** column headers, so users can generate values for an entire column where the action applies.

- 091d502: **Data Level selection for TikTok Ads performance reports**

  TikTok Ads `ad_insights` and `ad_insights_by_country` now honor the selected **Data Level** (advertiser, campaign, ad group, or ad), a dropdown in the main connector settings. The field selector pins only the unique-key fields that level requires — advertiser-level reports no longer force `ad_id` and can group by date alone. Choose Data Level before selecting fields; when changing it on a connector that already has data, use a new Data Mart so rows merge correctly.

- 55fcba9: **Reports table UX — discoverable actions**
  - Moved **Open document** and **Preview SQL** next to the report title.
  - Kept the **More actions** menu in the actions column.
  - Added tooltips for truncated report titles.

- 5a4eb6d: **Improve Document Link field UX**

  Simplified the Document Link section in the Google Sheets Report form (previously it showed three actions at once — URL input, Open, and Create document):
  - Show **Open document** only when a valid Google Sheets URL is provided.
  - Replace the disabled external-link icon with a contextual action.
  - Present **New Sheet** as an alternative to pasting a URL, via an "or" separator.
  - Update the input placeholder to "Paste a Google Sheets URL".
  - Replace the custom icon button with a standard ghost button.

- b0f0247: **Shared Login Customer ID field for Google Ads**

  The **Login Customer ID** is now a single top-level field shared across all authentication types, instead of a separate field nested inside each auth type. Previously the value could be lost when switching between authentication methods and was not reachable from the OAuth button flow. Existing connectors keep working — the old stored value is still read as a fallback. The field is now optional for Service Account authentication and appears directly under Customer ID in the configuration form.

- 18c8d9d: **Selective refresh and clearer failed-report errors in Google Sheets**
  - On **Refresh all reports**, each report shows its title, sheet, and last-run status, including a clear error message when the last run failed.
  - Choose which reports to refresh with checkboxes, select all, or target only failed, successful, or never-run reports.
  - On the single-report refresh screen, failed runs show the actual error details and an **Open report** action.
  - The same last-run error details are available from the **All reports** list.

- 7d09e62: **HTTP Data streaming supports aggregations and date buckets**

  The HTTP Data streaming API, the [`@owox/api-client`](../../docs/api/api-client.md) `traverseData()` method, and the [`owox-ctl data-marts stream`](../../docs/api/owox-ctl.md) command now accept `aggregation` and `dateTrunc` parameters (`--aggregation` / `--date-bucket` on the CLI), matching the grouping already available for Reports. Any selected column without an aggregation rule becomes a grouping key, so you can stream pre-aggregated rows — for example monthly revenue totals — directly from a published Data Mart without building a Report. Grand totals and the applied aggregation are recorded in the HTTP_DATA run history.

- 0781310: **Clearer permission errors when managing Storages, Destinations, and Data Marts**

  Permission errors now name the exact role required — such as owner with the Technical User role, or Project Admin — and the "access forbidden" toast stays on screen until dismissed. Previously these actions failed with a vague message that did not explain who could perform them, and the error toast disappeared after a few seconds.

- 5595bbd: **Google Sheets A1 note shows import finish time**

  The A1 cell note for a Google Sheets export now records when the import **finished** (written in the finalize step after all data is on the sheet), not when the first data batch started writing. While rows are still streaming, only the short ODM marker is present; the full provenance block (`Imported at …`, data mart title, and link) is written at the end.

- 1fc1bd2: **Clearer report details, errors, and recovery in Google Sheets**

  The Data Mart section on a report card no longer shows "Details are unavailable" while loading — you now see a loading indicator, a clear message if details fail to load, or "No details available" when there's no description or owners. When a report cannot run because columns are missing from the Data Mart schema, the extension shows the same actionable error as OWOX Data Marts (including which columns to uncheck). If a report is created but its first run fails, the editor still opens so you can fix the setup and retry. Valid report slices stay in sync with OWOX Data Marts and no longer appear broken.

- 33cb1ec: **Fix BigQuery report runs when the table name matches a filter column**

  BigQuery report runs failed when a Table Data Mart's unaliased table short name matched a filtered column — BigQuery treats the short name as a row `STRUCT` alias, so the generated SQL compared a `STRUCT` to a string (for example on Google Sheets export for a table such as `…country` filtered on a `country` column). Output-controls and explicit-projection queries now alias the source as `src` and qualify filter/sort references (`` src.`country` ``) in `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, and `HAVING`, while `SELECT` and `GROUP BY` stay unqualified so nested RECORD paths keep their shape. Existing reports need no reconfiguration.

- b1fc8ff: **Output schema edits no longer get silently reverted**

  Unchecking a column (Alias or Description) no longer becomes visible again after a few seconds or resets on tab switch, and toggling "Hidden from reports" on a field while an AI-generated alias or description was still loading is no longer undone once generation finishes. Column visibility now persists per data mart across tab switches and reloads, and edits made while AI generation is running are preserved. Generating metadata that fills in nothing new no longer marks the schema as unsaved.

- 97f0c0f: **Correct joined data mart aggregations and flag missing primary keys**

  When a joinable field is deduplicated with a count (COUNT / Count Unique), its value in the blended result is now a whole number, so reports can sum, average, or take min/max of it (arithmetic aggregations appear automatically, Sum active by default) instead of collapsing the joined events into a concatenated string and under-counting them — fixing funnel-style reports (sessions, add-to-carts, purchases across shared dimensions). Slices (pre-join filters) on such a field now offer the operators for its original type, since a slice runs on raw values before the join. Separately, a joined data mart with no primary key now shows a "No primary key" warning in both the relationship list and the graph, because without a key the join cannot deduplicate rows reliably and metrics can be double-counted (fan-out).

- 345d78e: **Report totals cover every selected metric, not just numeric fields**

  Report totals — returned by the `query_data_mart` MCP tool and retrievable for a Data Mart run via its `x-owox-run-id` — now cover every aggregated metric, including `Count` and `Count Unique` on text, date, or boolean columns across both native and joined Data Mart fields. Previously totals covered numeric fields only, so a scorecard aggregating a text column (for example the number of distinct countries) came back empty even though the run succeeded. `Sample` (`ANY_VALUE`) and `Combined` (`STRING_AGG`) are no longer included in totals, since neither reduces to a meaningful grand total.

- 873c74f: **Report column picker fixes**

  Adding a column in the Aggregations panel now opens the aggregation editor immediately (instead of an icon that required a second click), and its Apply button stays disabled until you pick a function or bucket, so a new column can no longer be discarded by an empty Apply. The auto-generated "Unique count" row now uses the same font as the other fields. The relative-date "Last N days/months" filter input can be cleared with Backspace instead of snapping back to 0. When editing a single filter or slice, a trash button in the editor header now lets you delete it directly.

- be8a495: **Cross-platform Windows support for dev scripts and git hooks**

  Two Unix-only assumptions broke first-time setup on Windows. Inline `VAR=value command` environment-variable assignments (e.g. `npm run dev -w owox` and the package `test` scripts) are now wrapped with `cross-env` so they run under cmd/PowerShell (no new dependency — `cross-env` is already a hoisted root devDependency — and no lockfile change). The husky setup no longer emits a Windows batch-style pre-commit hook (`@echo off …`) that failed with `@echo: command not found` under `sh` (which Git uses on every OS) and blocked commits; it now writes a POSIX shell hook in the husky v9 format, self-heals only the stale formats it previously generated (leaving hand-edited hooks untouched), and clears the `husky - DEPRECATED` warning that breaks under husky v10.

- 72f3d47: **API surface maintenance**
  - **Project settings API** — the endpoints now publish explicit OpenAPI request/response contracts; `@owox/api-client` adds `project.getSettings()` and `project.updateDescription()`.
  - **Models canvas API** — `@owox/api-client` exposes paginated Models canvas data marts via `models.getDataMarts()` and their visible relationship edges via `models.getEdges()`.
  - **Project setup progress API** — `GET /api/project-setup-progress` publishes an explicit OpenAPI response contract; `@owox/api-client` adds `project.getSetupProgress()` and exports `OWOXProjectSetupProgress`, `OWOXProjectSetupProgressSteps`, and `OWOXProjectSetupStepState`.
  - **Project run history API** — `@owox/api-client` adds `runs.getHistory({ limit, offset })` and exports `OWOXProjectDataMartRunsResponse`, `OWOXProjectDataMartRun`, `OWOXProjectDataMartRunRef`, `OWOXProjectDataMartRunUser`, `OWOXProjectDataMartRunStatus`, `OWOXProjectDataMartRunType`, `OWOXProjectDataMartRunTriggerType`, and `OWOXProjectRunHistoryOptions`.
  - **Project insight-template discovery API** — `@owox/api-client` adds `insights.getTemplates({ limit, offset })` and exports `OWOXProjectInsightTemplatesResponse`, `OWOXProjectInsightTemplate`, `OWOXProjectInsightTemplateDataMartRef`, `OWOXProjectInsightTemplateUser`, and `OWOXProjectInsightTemplateListOptions`; each result includes its Data Mart reference, creator metadata when available, and the current member's `canDelete` state.
  - **Markdown rendering API** — `POST /api/markdown/parse-to-html` publishes an explicit OpenAPI contract; `@owox/api-client` adds `markdown.parseToHtml({ markdown })` and exports `OWOXMarkdownParseRequest` and `OWOXMarkdownParseResponse`.
  - **Auth context introspection** — `GET /api/auth/context` publishes an explicit OpenAPI response contract; `@owox/api-client` exposes `auth.getContext()` and `OWOXAuthContext` for validating a configured API key and reading its project/member context without exposing the secret.
  - **Require interactive authentication for OAuth flows** — OAuth routes under `/api/connectors/{connectorName}/oauth`, `/api/data-destinations/oauth`, `/api/data-destinations/{id}/oauth`, `/api/data-storages/oauth`, and `/api/data-storages/{id}/oauth`, plus `POST /api/data-destinations/connect/google-sheets`, now reject API-key authentication and require an interactive user session. API-key access to non-OAuth resource operations is unchanged.
  - **Publish canonical API-key authentication headers** — protected operations now declare `X-OWOX-Authorization` and, only when API-key-derived tokens are accepted, the optional `X-OWOX-Api-Key-Id` header (must match the token's API key ID). Routes that reject API-key authentication omit that conditional header, while `POST /api/auth/api-keys/exchange` retains its required API key ID input. Runtime authentication behavior is unchanged.

### Patch Changes 0.30.0

- 52149e4: # Fix nested blended field name collisions in joinable data marts

  Nested (struct) fields in joined sources no longer share report column names with flat siblings after dots are replaced with underscores. For example, flat `campaign_id` and nested `campaign.id` under the same join alias now produce distinct unified names (`ads__campaign_id` vs `ads__campaign_id__a8702665`).
  - **Flat blended names** stay byte-for-byte unchanged; existing reports that only use flat joined columns need no config changes.
  - **Nested blended names** always include a stable 8-character hash of `(aliasPath, originalFieldName)`. New saves and reloads use the hashed form end-to-end.
  - **Legacy nested names** in already-saved `columnConfig` / filter / sort (pre-hash form such as `customers__campaign_id` for `campaign.id`) are intentionally not migrated in this release and will not resolve after deploy. That population was empty when this shipped; a follow-up migration can re-key them if needed. The pre-join filter migration (`MigratePreJoinFilterToUnifiedColumn`) still emits the pre-hash form for historical rules only.
  - **Rolling deploy:** during a mixed old/new backend fleet, nested-field reports saved or run mid-rollout can briefly orphan until every pod serves the hashed names. Self-heals once the fleet is fully on the new version; prefer rolling through before bulk-editing nested-column reports.

- 36fb4d3: **Data Mart report aggregations**

  Reports can now aggregate Data Mart data server-side across all supported storages (BigQuery, Athena, Snowflake, Redshift, Databricks).
  - **Group-by + metric functions** — `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `COUNT`, `COUNT_DISTINCT`, `STRING_AGG`, and percentiles `P25`/`P50`/`P75`/`P95`. Every selected column without an aggregation rule becomes a grouping key.
  - **Date bucketing** (`dateTruncConfig`) — group a date/timestamp dimension by `DAY`/`WEEK`/`MONTH`/`QUARTER`/`YEAR`, with an optional per-rule IANA `timeZone` applied before truncation.
  - **Aggregated column naming** — outputs are named `<column> | <TOKEN>` (e.g. `revenue | SUM`, `customer_id | COUNTUNIQUE`) and carry the function's effective type. A column can carry several functions, each as its own output column.
  - **Auto Row Count** — aggregated reports automatically include a `Row Count` (`COUNT(*)`) column.
  - **Unique Count** (`uniqueCountConfig`) — opt-in `COUNT(DISTINCT <primary key>)`, with composite primary key support; rejected at save time if the Data Mart has no primary key.
  - **Post-aggregation filtering (`HAVING`)** — a filter on an aggregated output column is auto-routed to `HAVING` instead of row-level `WHERE`; the `(column, function)` pair must match a configured aggregation.
  - **Joined Data Marts** — post-join aggregation over the joined result, in addition to the existing pre-join join-rollup.
  - **Totals** — a per-column summary over the full filtered dataset (no grouping), computed as a separate query and surfaced through the HTTP Data API's run subtree. Push destinations (Google Sheets, Email/Slack/Teams/Chat) don't compute totals; Row Count and Unique Count are excluded from totals.
  - **Governance** — each schema field carries a dimension/metric role, a type-derived set of supported aggregations, and an on-by-default subset, with per-field override.
  - **UI** — a new **AGG** control next to output controls, plus a per-field AGG icon, configure grouping, multi-aggregation, date bucketing, and timezone.

  Backend adds three additive nullable report columns (`aggregationConfig`, `dateTruncConfig`, `uniqueCountConfig`) plus save-time validation. **Deployment ordering:** deploy the backend before shipping a Google Sheets Extension build that exposes new aggregation options, since the extension's function list has no compile-time guard against drift from the API.

- 627880f: **Auto-create Google Sheets documents for reports**

  A "Create document" action in the Google Sheets report form auto-creates a new spreadsheet for the selected destination and fills in its link. Works for both auth methods — OAuth (document created in the connected account's Drive and shared with the requesting user) and Service Account (created in a configured Shared Drive folder).
  - Destinations can target a Drive folder: paste a folder URL for Service Account destinations (validated on save — must be a Shared Drive folder the service account can write to), or pick one via the Google Drive Picker for OAuth destinations.
  - The Picker requires a new `GOOGLE_PICKER_API_KEY` environment variable.
  - The OAuth destination flow now also requests the `drive.file` scope — existing OAuth destinations must reconnect to grant it before folder placement and sharing work.

- e575e99: **Smart search for Data Marts, storages, and destinations**

  Added semantic search functionality for finding project Data Marts, Storages, and Destinations from the project search index.

- e8b87e3: # **MCP tools**
  - e8b87e3: Added **`summarize_data_catalog`** — high-level summary of the project's published Data Mart catalog: total count, top Data Marts ranked by relationship connectivity, report/trigger usage, and recent updates. Returns only Data Marts visible to the current member; does not query row data.
  - e8b87e3: Added **`get_data_mart_details_by_id`** — a Data Mart's id, name, description, and output schema fields, including `joined_fields` (blended fields with qualified names, source Data Mart, and allowed aggregations).
  - f680592: Added **`query_data_mart`** — query a Data Mart directly: pick fields, filter (pre-join slices and post-join filters), aggregate (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `COUNT_DISTINCT`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`, percentiles), bucket dates by day/week/month/quarter/year, and get server-side totals. Runs against the warehouse, recorded in Run History (query definition and SQL only, never row values), and costs credits per call.
  - 7e3ce65: Added **`get_data_mart_reports`** — list reports tied to a Data Mart, including destination, owner, all run schedules (cron, timezone, active flag), last run time, and last run status.
  - c1485c0: Added **`add_report`** — create a report exporting a Data Mart to a Google Sheets destination; a new sheet is created and linked automatically. Currently supports Google Sheets only.
  - 4fe2c6e: Added **`update_report`** — rename a report or change its exported fields; anything not mentioned (destination, filters, sorting, owners, schedules) stays unchanged.
  - 5ed5a23: Added **`run_report` and `get_report_run_status`** — start a report run by id (returns immediately with report id and run id; data delivers to the report's push destination), then poll status (running, success, failed, cancelled, interrupted, restricted) with `queued_at`, `started_at`, and `raw_status`. Status responses include `should_poll` and `stop_reason` guidance, recommending ~15-second polling intervals. Pull-based destinations (Data Studio, HTTP Data API) can't be run this way. Starting a run requires `mcp:write`; checking status only requires `mcp:read`.
  - b8732c5: Added **`delete_report`** — marked destructive so assistants confirm before calling. The underlying Data Mart, destination, and already-exported documents are unaffected.
  - e8499d4: Added **report run schedule management** — four tools to list, create, update, and delete recurring report run schedules by trigger id, respecting project and report permissions. Creating, updating, or deleting requires both `mcp:read` and `mcp:write`.
  - 5f7dbcf: Added **`list_destinations`** — list available destinations with name, type, owner, and shared-for-use status.
  - 9f2ca93: Added **`add_destination`** — create a new destination. Email-based destinations (email, Slack, Teams, Google Chat) and Looker Studio are created and ready immediately; Google Sheets destinations require the user to connect their Google account via a linked in-app page. Every destination created this way starts unshared until a human reviews and shares it.

- 964d886: **Protect unsaved Output Schema changes from being lost**

  When a Data Mart's Output Schema has unsaved changes, a prompt now appears before any action that would replace it, with three choices: **Save & continue**, **Discard & continue**, or **Cancel**. Triggered by generating field aliases or descriptions with AI, refreshing the schema, publishing the Data Mart, updating the input source, or leaving the page.

- 662871c: **API-key exchange and auth context**

  Project member API keys can now be exchanged for IDP access tokens in Better Auth and the development Null IDP. Exchanged tokens are bound to the API key ID and are rejected from API-key management, project-member administration, user provisioning, Intercom identity, and MCP OAuth authorization endpoints.
  - `@owox/api-client` now exposes `client.auth.getContext()`; `owox-ctl status` includes the project and member context resolved from the exchanged token, without exposing key secrets.
  - The auth-context endpoint uses IDP token introspection, and Better Auth refreshes API-key token context from current user and membership state during introspection.
  - Exchanged tokens include the project title used by auth-context responses, and now expire after 15 minutes, so clients re-exchange the underlying API key instead of holding indefinitely valid access tokens.
  - Magic links now carry the encrypted invite role through the callback path, so callback query normalization no longer drops the role before the user is added to the project.

- 2a71167: **Automatic retry and clearer error messages for Criteo Ads imports**

  Criteo Ads imports now automatically retry on server errors, rate limits, and network issues, so brief outages on Criteo's side no longer stop an import. When an import still fails, logs now include the HTTP status, the provider's own error message, and a note when the failure looks temporary. Previously a temporary server error failed the whole import immediately with only a raw stack trace in the logs.

- d80b20d: **Report Column Picker search and layout improvements**
  - Added a search bar that works across native and blended Data Mart columns.
  - Clear empty state when no matching columns are found.
  - Reorganized toolbar for easier access to selection controls and search.
  - Search works together with **Show selected only** and **Select all**.

- 19a666c: **Published OWOX Data Marts MCP in ChatGPT Apps**

![OWOX Data Marts – v0.28.0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9db0633-4566-4c5e-8ac2-3dfcb3a29cfc)

- 0165f6b: **Google Sheets Extension menu and sidebar updates**
  - **All Reports** — new menu item lists every report in the current document with its sheet name, last run status, and last run time, with direct access to open any report.
  - **Create new report** — new menu item creates a new sheet and opens the report creation form in one step.
  - **Report run failure reason** — hover the last run status icon in the sidebar to see why a run failed.
  - **Reliable active sheet tracking** — the sidebar correctly follows the active sheet when switching between sheets quickly.

- dad37e4: **Executed SQL in Run History**

  Report runs now record the exact SQL that ran — with output controls applied and filter parameter values inlined as literals — in a dedicated **Executed SQL** block in Run History. Previously only the raw Data Mart query was stored, which didn't reflect the parameters used at run time. Covers Google Sheets, Email, Slack, Google Chat, Microsoft Teams, and Looker Studio. The block appears only when output controls or blended SQL were applied.

- 8b20d18, 2a2efa1: **Output controls for Databricks and Snowflake**

  Filters, slices, sort, and limit are now supported on Databricks and Snowflake Data Marts, matching support already available for BigQuery, Athena, Redshift, and Legacy BigQuery. Filter values are correctly escaped per storage type; substring matchers avoid `LIKE` so user `%` and `_` stay literal. Available in the web app and the Google Sheets Extension.

- 0165f6b: **Quick run button for reports**

  Reports table now has a direct run button. A brief undo window appears before the run begins.

- 0165f6b: **Form validation and UI improvements**

  Submitting a form now opens any collapsed sections containing invalid fields and focuses the first error. Table filters now default to the `is` operator for fields that support both `contains` and `is`, and reset when switching filter fields. Project switcher menu received search, scroll-into-view, keyboard navigation, state reset on close, and accessibility improvements.

- 113ef2e: **Fail fast on disconnected report columns and output controls**

  Reports now reject orphaned column references upfront — after a joined Data Mart alias is renamed, a relationship is removed, or a field disappears from the schema or is hidden — instead of letting them leak into generated SQL and fail with a cryptic "Unrecognized name" error. The column picker shows a "Disconnected columns" block for stale selections; stale filter/slice rules are highlighted in red in Output Controls; the Output Controls button badge turns red when any control references a disconnected field.

- 19fbef7: **Readable field names and search in Output Controls**

  Filters, Slices, and Sort pickers now show the field's alias (or leaf column name), with the joined Data Mart name as a muted second line for blended fields, instead of raw nested identifiers. Each picker is now searchable by alias, Data Mart name, or technical field name.

- 25b43f6: **Criteo placement, category, and transaction reporting**

  Three new Criteo endpoints: placements, placement categories, and transactions. Added extra statistics dimensions (device, OS, channel) and reporting currency selection. Previously only campaign-level statistics were available.

- ffd8ef8: **Reliable incremental sync after partial connector run**

  The incremental date checkpoint is now written only after all accounts complete successfully. Previously, a mid-run failure could advance the checkpoint past data that was never fully fetched, silently skipping those dates on the next run. Affects MicrosoftAds, CriteoAds, GoogleAds, RedditAds, and XAds.

- fddcd83: **Criteo access token proactive refresh**

  The Criteo connector now refreshes the access token 60 seconds before it expires and retries any request that still returns an expired-token error. Previously the cached token was reused for the entire run without expiry checks, causing mid-run failures on long-running syncs.

- ec2fd8b: **Reconnect notice when Google Storage authorization expires**

  Expired authorization is now detected before a connector run starts and surfaced as a "Reconnect Storage" prompt, instead of starting the run and failing with an opaque authentication error. The storage health indicator updates automatically when access is lost.

- bbe8e34: **Drag-and-drop for service account JSON**

  Service account credential textareas now accept dropped JSON files, with JSON validation, file size limits, and error feedback.

- b856d11: **Shopify `totalOutstanding` field**

  Added `totalOutstanding` to Shopify orders — the total amount not yet transacted for the order.

- 39b4254: **Session invalidation on password change and reset**

  After a successful password change or reset, all other active sessions are revoked. The session that performed the change is preserved.

- e6e9296: **Unified column identifiers for output control slice filters**

  Slice (pre-join) filters now reference columns by the same fully qualified identifier as regular output filters (e.g. `category_details__item_event_count`) instead of a raw column name plus a separate `aliasPath`. Existing saved reports are migrated automatically.

- 1d2e04e: # **Bug fixes and improvements**
  - 1d2e04e: Fixed OAuth sign-in for ad platform connectors (Microsoft Ads, TikTok, LinkedIn, Google Ads) failing with "Not Found" after the provider authorization step — callback pages were routed to the backend instead of the web app. Affects both self-hosted and cloud deployments.
  - a222917: Fixed rotated Microsoft Ads refresh tokens not being persisted — OAuth responses returned a new token but it was discarded or overwrote the original user-provided token.
  - c110f35: Fixed AI Helper failing with `Unrecognized name: <field>` when the Output Schema contains disconnected fields. Disconnected fields are now excluded from the 30-row sample query; the fetch is skipped entirely when no connected fields remain.
  - f69f0b3: Fixed AI Helper failing with `Syntax error: Expected end of input but got "-"` for Data Marts whose fully qualified table name contains dashes (e.g. `my-project.dataset.my-table-name`). Table references and column names are now escaped per storage type via `IdentifierEscaperFacade`.
  - 4858830: Fixed missing validation feedback when a Google OAuth connection is required but not present.

- c782374: # Fix release build broken by duplicate google-auth-library

  A transitive dependency drift left two copies of `google-auth-library` (v10) in the
  tree — one hoisted at the root and a second pinned exactly by `googleapis-common` —
  which produced incompatible `OAuth2Client` types and broke the TypeScript build of the
  Google Sheets and BigQuery integrations. A scoped npm override now makes
  `googleapis-common` reuse the root copy, so the packages build and publish reliably again.

### Minor Changes 0.27.0

![OWOX Data Marts – v0.27.0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43d7a5c1-26d5-4c76-9368-405b1711e7aa)

- 3d80135: **OWOX Data Marts API access**

  Added [`owox-ctl`](../../docs/api/owox-ctl.md), the OWOX Data Marts Control CLI, and [`@owox/api-client`](../../docs/api/api-client.md), a TypeScript/JavaScript API client for custom integrations. `owox-ctl` resolves credentials from environment variables, supports `.env` / `--env-file`, and defaults to OWOX Data Marts Cloud at `https://app.owox.com`.

  Available commands:
  - `owox-ctl status`
  - `owox-ctl data-marts list`
  - `owox-ctl data-marts stream`
  - `owox-ctl storages list`
  - `owox-ctl destinations list`

- cb97897: **HTTP Data API — stream Data Mart rows over HTTP**

  A new `GET /api/external/http-data/data-marts/{id}.ndjson` endpoint streams a published Data Mart's rows as newline-delimited JSON for project members authenticated with their ODM member token (`x-owox-authorization`).
  - `columns=*` returns Data Mart output columns; `columns=**` includes joined fields. Repeated `column=<name>` parameters select exact columns.
  - Optional base64url-encoded `filter`/`sort` and a `limit` are supported.
  - Only reporting-visible columns are selectable — hidden fields and excluded blend sources are rejected.
  - Every pull is recorded as an `HTTP_DATA` run in run history and counted for consumption.

- c721847: **User provisioning and project access requests**

  Added project-level user provisioning settings and context-scoped defaults for newly provisioned users. Users who receive a project token without assigned roles now stay inside a restricted ODM app shell, where they can request access to the current project or create a new one.

- 02d3048: **SQL preview icon on all reports**

  The SQL preview icon is now visible on all reports (Google Sheets, Email, Looker Studio). For reports with output controls or joined fields, clicking it opens the generated SQL dialog. For reports without, it shows a tooltip explaining that the report queries the Data Mart source directly, with a link to Data Setup.

- a47929c: **Project-wide Data Mart activity pages**

  Added project-wide pages for Data Mart triggers, reports, insights, and run history. The lists support project-level search and filters and preserve row-level permissions for actions.

- 8d83268, 3aefb24, 29c3af2: **Output controls expanded to Athena, Legacy BigQuery, and Redshift**

  Filters, slices, sort, and limit are now supported on AWS Athena, Legacy BigQuery, and AWS Redshift data marts, matching existing standard BigQuery support. Controls are available in both the web app and the Google Sheets Extension, including the generated-SQL preview and the Looker Studio cached path.

  Additionally, relative-date presets are tightened across all storages: `last_n_days` and `last_n_months` now stop at today (previously future-dated rows could leak in), and `this_month` / `this_year` are clamped to the current period.

- 060e2f9: **Automatic schema evolution for Snowflake and Redshift**

  Adding new fields to an existing Snowflake or Redshift Data Mart no longer causes MERGE or INSERT failures. Both storages now query the live table schema on every run and issue `ALTER TABLE` to add any missing columns before writing data.

- 64fca08: **Cancel Data Mart runs from Run History**

  In-progress connector and report runs can now be cancelled from Run History. Cancellation stops associated run triggers, marks the run as cancelled in history, and asks for confirmation that stopping a run can leave data incomplete.

- 4f38486: **Facebook Ads reach reporting at ad set and campaign level**

  Two new Facebook Ads endpoints report daily performance aggregated at the ad set and campaign level, with reach deduplicated to match the numbers shown in Meta Ads Manager. Previously, reach was only available per ad, so totals summed across ads overcounted the same people.

- fd7d9be: **Google Sheets destination access email visible for both auth methods**

  The email address that needs document access was previously only shown for Service Account connections. It is now displayed and copyable in one click — in both the destination form and the report form — for Service Account and Google OAuth alike.

- 62af9fb: **Default row limit for Google Sheets reports**

  New Google Sheets reports now apply a default limit of 10,000 rows instead of returning all rows, to prevent hitting Google Sheets cell limits. The output controls icon reflects the applied limit, and a tooltip is shown before the first run.

- 2f28f1d: **Availability labels renamed to "Shared for…"**

  "Available for use", "Available for reporting", and "Available for maintenance" are now "Shared for use", "Shared for reporting", and "Shared for maintenance". The "Not available" filter option is now "Not shared".

- 4409afe: **Clearer API error messages for resource access**

  Error messages returned when access is denied or a resource is not found now use product names — "Data Mart", "Data Storage", "Data Destination", "Technical User", "Project Admin" — instead of the former internal identifiers `DataMart`, `DataStorage`, `DataDestination`, `editor`, `admin`.

- 4656de0: **Anonymous CLI usage telemetry**

  `owox serve` now sends a single anonymous event on successful startup. Collected data: a random identifier (not derived from your machine or network), CLI/Node versions, OS platform/arch, and Docker/IDP/web flags. No hostnames, file paths, emails, or IP-derived identity are ever collected. Opt out by setting `OWOX_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` or `DO_NOT_TRACK=1`. Automatically disabled in CI.

- 0753de2: **Faster Google Sheets import from BigQuery views**

  Data Marts based on a BigQuery VIEW now import into Google Sheets faster and more reliably for large datasets. Previously, large views could stop responding mid-import and deliver no data at all.

- f573073: **Improved SQLite runtime stability**

  Improved runtime stability for SQLite-backed deployments, focusing on scheduled run processing and transaction coordination during concurrent background activity.

- 62af9fb: # **Bug fixes and improvements**
  - 62af9fb: Fixed connector-based Data Mart definition type and connector settings appearing empty after switching tabs when no Storage was configured. Connector-based Data Marts can now be saved without a configured Storage.
  - c6d9af1: Fixed graph zoom controls for deep relationship graphs where fit-to-view scaled the graph below the previous fixed zoom floor.

![OWOX Data Marts – v0.26.0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3d79515-3034-4273-93e6-00e83d92b83b)

- 10c540e: **New OWOX Extension for Google Sheets — public release 🎉**

  The next-generation [OWOX Extension for Google Sheets](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/owox_data_marts/94902851409?utm_source=changelog) is now published on the Google Workspace Marketplace, replacing the legacy add-on. It brings Data Marts directly into Google Sheets with a redesigned UX and reaches parity with the previous Extension on the workflows users relied on.
  - **Column picker with field-level descriptions** — pick which Data Mart fields to pull into the sheet without SQL, with the alias and description from the Data Mart's Output Schema shown next to each field.
  - **All Scheduled Reports page** — a single place to see every report scheduled from the Extension, across spreadsheets and projects, subject to the user's permissions.
  - **Filters and slices on report output** — apply pre-join slices and post-join filters to shape what a report returns without editing the Data Mart.
  - **Refresh Current and Refresh All** — re-run a single report or every report on the sheet in one click.
  - **Granular permissions with Contexts support** — the Extension honours the full permissions model: per-member, per-entity availability flags, and Project Contexts so a user sees only the Data Marts, Storages, and Destinations relevant to their team. When OAuth scopes are missing or revoked, the Extension explains what's wrong and walks the user through re-granting access.
  - **In-product support via Intercom** — chat with the OWOX team without leaving the sidebar.

- 85b150c: **Default fields for connector endpoints**

  Each connector endpoint now ships with a curated set of pre-selected default fields, so users no longer have to choose fields from scratch on first use. Endpoint overviews and descriptions were also rewritten for clarity.

- c083319: **Data Mart run indicator**

  An "Updating data" badge with an animated spinner now appears in the Data Mart header during active runs. The badge includes a "View runs" button for one-click access to run history. The manual run button is disabled while another run is in progress, with a tooltip explaining why.

- 5b55bf2: **Membership requests on the Members page**

  Project Admins can now review and act on pending project join requests from Project Settings → Members. Pending requests appear as a collapsible card above the members list. Clicking a request opens a side sheet to assign role, role scope, and contexts before approving, or to decline with a confirmation dialog. The section is admin-only and hidden when there are no pending requests.

- 134884f: **"Enable Google Sheets" checklist group for onboarding**

  Users whose `onboarding.use_case` contains `sync_dwh_sheets` or `import_external_sheets` now see a dedicated "Enable Google Sheets" group in the Setup Checklist instead of the generic "Get data to your report" group. Three steps: create a Google Sheets Destination, install the Extension, and create and run a report from it. The group is non-blocking and auto-updates as users complete each step.

- c520e17: **Stricter OAuth credential checks when creating Destinations**

  Creating a Google Sheets destination with a pre-existing `credentialId` now enforces two checks already present on destination updates:
  - **Project ownership** — the credential must belong to the same project. Cross-project references are rejected with `403 Forbidden — Credential does not belong to this project`.
  - **Copy permission** — if the credential is already linked to another destination, the caller must have copy-credentials access on that destination. Without it, the request is rejected with `403 Forbidden — You do not have permission to copy credentials from this destination`.

  Legitimate flows are unaffected — a fresh `credentialId` returned by the OAuth callback is not yet linked to any destination and passes both checks transparently.

- 31ae838: **Clarified Microsoft Ads account and customer ID fields**

  Docs and in-product field tips now explicitly state that Account ID and Customer ID must be the numeric API identifiers from the `aid` and `cid` URL parameters, not the alphanumeric numbers shown elsewhere in the Microsoft Ads UI.

- dcd4b55: # **Bug fixes and improvements**
  - dcd4b55: Fixed Business Owner assignment reducing a Technical User's access. A Technical User tagged as Business Owner of a Data Mart that was _Available for maintenance_ lost Edit, Delete, and Manage Triggers — actions they would have had as a non-owner Technical User. Permissions now combine two paths: an ownership floor (always guarantees See + Use for any owner) and the non-owner sharing path (role-based maintenance actions). Context and role scope still apply to maintenance actions: a member with `Selected contexts only` scope needs a context overlap with the Data Mart for maintenance access. Business Users assigned as Business Owner are unchanged — they still receive See + Use only, as the Business User role does not permit Data Mart maintenance.
  - ce7d14d: Fixed empty Data Mart titles when emoji or special characters are entered — users now see a clear message that these characters are not supported for Legacy BigQuery storage.
  - ce7d14d: Fixed unexpected delay when loading Destinations in the Extension; hidden reporting fields no longer appear in the column picker; improved empty state for new users.
  - da6e5f0: Fixed ambiguous column errors in blended report filters and sorting — WHERE and ORDER BY clauses now qualify every reference with the correct CTE alias (`main.<col>` for native columns, `<subsidiary>.<alias>` for blended fields). Fixed duplicate CTE names when two relationships shared the same `targetAlias` — CTE names are now derived from the full `aliasPath` (dots → underscores) to guarantee uniqueness.
  - d0f5455: Fixed React SVG attribute warnings in Microsoft Teams and Azure Synapse icon components.
  - c9f5bea: Fixed project notification settings endpoints (`projects/:projectId/notification-settings*`) accepting a caller-controlled project ID — an authenticated user could previously read or modify another project's notification configuration.

![OWOX Data Marts – v0.25.0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e0800ac-f404-4986-a66b-53603cfd6e02)

- 9bb6393: **AI helper for Data Mart metadata**

  A Sparkles ✨ button appears next to title, description, field alias, and field description inputs. Click it to get an AI-generated draft grounded in the Data Mart's schema and up to 30 sample rows. Nothing is saved until you explicitly apply the suggestion.
  - Bulk fill available via **Generate field descriptions** and **Generate field aliases** next to _Refresh schema_ — populates the whole Output Schema at once for review before saving.
  - Available for SQL, Table, View, and Table Pattern definitions. Connector-based Data Marts are not yet supported.
  - Self-hosted deployments: set `AI_BASE_URL`, `AI_API_KEY`, and `AI_MODEL` in the environment to enable the buttons.

- 480a3be: **Bulk import of Data Marts from BigQuery**

  A new **Import…** button on the Data Marts page opens a picker that lists every table and view in the selected BigQuery storage. Select up to 20 resources and click **Create** — each becomes its own Data Mart named after the resource. Sharded tables (e.g. `events_20240101`, `events_20240102`) are recognized automatically and shown as a single `events_*` entry that creates a Table Pattern Data Mart. If the storage has broken credentials, the dialog explains what's wrong and offers a one-click shortcut to finish setup.

- 9e5e3e0: **Google Sheets export preserves column layout and side-by-side formulas**

  Refreshing an OWOX → Google Sheets report no longer wipes the entire tab. The exporter only touches the cells it owns, so anything else in the same sheet — extra columns, formulas, pivot tables, charts, named ranges — stays intact across refreshes.
  - Your column order wins. Reordering columns in the Output Schema after the first refresh no longer rearranges the sheet.
  - New SQL columns are appended on the right; removed columns disappear cleanly and leave a `#REF!` signal on any formula that depended on them.
  - Formulas in the first data row are automatically filled down across all new rows.
  - Output Schema aliases update the sheet header without rewriting the whole tab.
  - A failed refresh no longer wipes existing data — the sheet stays as last seen and the Data Mart status flips to "failed".

- da9bd7e: **Output controls per report — filters, sort, and row limit**

  A new **Output controls** panel in the Report Columns picker lets you shape what each report writes to its destination without changing the underlying Data Mart.
  - **Filters** apply WHERE-style conditions on the final SELECT. Multiple filters on the same column are combined with `AND`. Filtering by a column not selected for output is supported.
  - **Sort** orders output by one or more columns with `asc`/`desc` per column; drag to reorder priorities.
  - **Limit** caps the number of rows written. Leave empty for no limit.
  - Filter values are passed as named parameters (`@p0`, `@p1`, …), not inlined SQL.
  - Currently supported on BigQuery. Athena, Redshift, Snowflake, and Databricks will return a clear capability error until their adapters land.

- 814790c: **Report runs and trigger management for all Data Mart viewers**

  Manual report runs and Report Trigger CRUD are now available to any project member who can see the Data Mart and use the Destination — not just the Report owner. Report config editing (columns, filters, owners, destination) remains restricted to owners with an effective Destination.

- 99acce6: **New Data Marts, Storages, and Destinations are available by default**

  Newly created entities now default to `Available for reporting / use = ON`, so other project members can see them immediately. The `Available for maintenance` toggle still defaults to OFF. Existing entities are not migrated.

- 8cb62c9: **Improved BigQuery location search and grouping**

  Country names are now included in every location label (e.g. "Saudi Arabia" resolves to `me-central2 Dammam`). The catch-all "Other" group is replaced with dedicated Middle East, South America, and Africa groups. Three previously missing regions added: `northamerica-south1` (Querétaro, Mexico), `us-south1` (Dallas, United States), `europe-west10` (Berlin, Germany).

- 68ff850: **Looker Studio destination renamed to Data Studio**

  Renamed consistently across the destination type dropdown, availability toggle, report cards, run history, sidebar help menu, setup checklist, and notification labels. Existing configurations and dashboards are unaffected.

- a147210: **Storage picker button integrated into input field**

  The table/view picker button now appears inside the Fully Qualified Name input rather than next to it. Shows "Select…" with a database icon when empty; collapses to an icon-only button with "Change selection" tooltip when a value is set.

- 3d3c8d3: **Contextual promo and health UX for bulk Data Mart creation**

  When exactly one BigQuery Data Mart is configured, users now see a prompt to bulk-create Data Marts from existing tables and views. Resource browsers in storage pickers now show a health-state block instead of raw loading errors when the selected storage is not fully configured.

- 118e029: **Google Sheets promo and Email Reports owners column**

  Published Data Marts without a Google Sheets destination now show a contextual promo with a direct CTA to create one. Email Reports table now displays report owners as an avatar group.

- c2099e1: **"New Report" and "New Trigger" labels and empty states**

  Button labels standardized to "New Report" and "New Trigger" across the app. Empty states for destinations now show a prominent "New Report" button directly in place. Google Sheets destination empty state includes suggestions to invite teammates.

- 0cbca4d: **Report creation button enabled as soon as all fields are valid**

  The "Create & Run report" button no longer requires manually editing the default title to become active. It enables as soon as all required fields are filled.

- 661b280: **Data Mart table navigation and dialog improvements**
  - Cmd/Ctrl+Click on a Data Mart row opens it in a new tab.
  - Long Data Mart and report titles in delete dialogs now wrap correctly.
  - Sticky action cells no longer show a transparent background during scroll.

- f717600: **Accessibility and dark mode improvements**

  Extracted reusable `TableSelectionCheckbox` component used across all tables. Added `id`/`htmlFor` label associations to Switch components. Enabled sorting by Contexts column in Data Mart, Storage, and Destination tables. Fixed dark mode styles for health status ring indicators.

- 262a9c0: # **Bug fixes and improvements**
  - 262a9c0: Fixed wrong Input Source shown in the Data Marts list — the mismatch appeared when any Data Mart in the list had multiple owners or contexts assigned.
  - 4172cb7: Fixed incorrect column types and aggregations for blended fields from joined Data Marts in Looker Studio. `COUNT`/`COUNT_DISTINCT` now appear as numeric metrics; `STRING_AGG`/`ANY_VALUE` as dimensions; `MIN`/`MAX`/`SUM` use the correct matching aggregation. Fix applies across BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, Athena, and Databricks.

![OWOX Data Marts – v0.24.0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1147e6ca-26c6-41ad-b6ba-b2d1bf4f632c)

- b335552: **Joinable Data Marts and joined reports**

  Data Marts can now be connected to each other, and reports can combine fields from several joined Data Marts in a single output.

  On a Data Mart's **Data Setup** tab, the new **Joinable Data Marts** block lets you add joinable Data Marts, configure join conditions, choose which fields each joined Data Mart exposes, and override their aliases or aggregations. When editing a Google Sheets, Looker Studio, or Email report, the **Report Columns** picker now shows fields from the base Data Mart together with fields from all joined Data Marts. The generated SQL is available for inspection, and any joined report can be saved as a standalone Data Mart.

  Supported on BigQuery, Snowflake, Redshift, Athena, and Databricks.

- d187cdf: **Project contexts and role scope**

  Added business-domain Contexts and per-member Role Scope to narrow what shared resources a non-owner can see.
  - Admins define Contexts in Project Settings, attach them to Data Marts, Storages, and Destinations, and pick between `Entire project` and `Selected contexts` for each member.
  - Owners and admins are never gated by Contexts.
  - Introduced a unified **Project Settings** page (Overview, Members, Contexts, Credit consumption, Subscription, Notification) that replaces the separate Members page.

- e817c93: **Setup checklist for guided onboarding**

  Added a **Setup Checklist** that guides new users through the key steps required to start working with the product. Each step includes a direct call to action, the checklist tracks progress in real time, and steps are grouped into logical stages.

- c669d11: **OAuth for LinkedIn Ads and LinkedIn Pages**

  Added OAuth authorization flow for both LinkedIn connectors, including UI login, callback handling, credential exchange, and token-backed execution. Existing LinkedIn configurations are migrated to the OAuth2 structure with compatibility for previously saved settings.

- ba44a8d: **Table and view browser for BigQuery Data Marts**

  A new **Fill from Storage** button lets you browse available tables and views through a `project → dataset → table` hierarchy. Selecting a table or view automatically fills the Fully Qualified Name field. Manual entry remains available as an alternative.

- d118b10: **Improved Data Mart publishing experience**
  - Data starts loading automatically after publishing a connector-based Data Mart.
  - Guidance now focuses on scheduling automatic updates instead of manual runs.
  - Promo messages appear only once.
  - Updated button labels and tooltips for better clarity.

- 3f8b831: **Data Mart page layout and table usability improvements**
  - Sticky actions column keeps row actions always visible during horizontal scroll.
  - Row actions are emphasized on hover to reduce visual noise.
  - Long values (including strings without spaces) now wrap correctly in tables and titles.
  - Refined layout behavior across different screen sizes.
  - Scrollable tabs now show a gradient fade indicator at the edge to signal hidden overflow.

- d8e7e84: **Project Settings documentation**

  New documentation section covering members, roles, and resource access. Includes three pages: Members Management, Roles and Permissions, and Ownership and Availability (with per-entity access tables for Storage, Data Mart, Destination, Report, and their Triggers).

- ba44a8d: **Enhanced security headers**

  Improved HTTP security headers now apply automatically to all application pages and authentication screens: Content Security Policy against clickjacking, Strict Transport Security for HTTPS enforcement, XSS and content-type protection, and referrer policy controls.

- ba44a8d: **Improved BigQuery configuration validation**

  Invalid project ID values are now caught immediately when saving OAuth-authenticated BigQuery storages, with clear error messages to correct typos or formatting issues before they cause runtime errors.

- 160574a: # **Bug fixes and improvements**
  - 160574a: Unconfigured storages now show a grey health indicator with the message "Complete setup to activate Storage" instead of a red one. Red is reserved for storages that have been configured but fail validation.
  - 50366c4: Fixed `campaign_id` and `adgroup_id` fields in `tiktok_ads_ad_insights` — both were always `null` due to missing parent-hierarchy IDs in the API request. Both fields are now correctly populated.

![OWOX Data Marts – v0.23.0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8bfad6e5-a8cc-4859-8de6-7be54d5f3a83)

- d8b82e5: **Ownership foundations**

  Ownership is now explicit and visible across all major entities. This is the first stage of the Permissions Model Evolution — ownership is informational only and does not affect access control.
  - Data Mart has **separate Technical Owner and Business Owner**, editable on the Overview tab.
  - Storage, Destination, and Report **each have an Owners list**, editable in the configuration sheet and saved together with the entity.
  - **Creator is auto-assigned** as owner when a new entity is created.
  - **Owners column** is displayed in Storage, Destination, and Report list tables.
  - **Filter by owner** is available in Data Marts, Storages, and Destinations lists.
  - **"Not assigned" state** is shown when an entity has no owners.

- 11c0c77: **Availability model and owner-based access control**

  Introduced explicit availability settings for DataMarts, Storages, and Destinations (`Available for reporting / Available for maintenance` and `Available for use / Available for maintenance`). Ownership now affects access: owners have direct access to their entities regardless of availability state, while non-owners see only available entities.
  - Implemented table-driven `AccessDecisionService` that evaluates entity type, role, ownership status, availability state, and action for every single-entity operation.
  - Enforced access checks on all endpoints including direct URL access, sub-operations (SQL dry run, validate definition, run history), and report creation.
  - Existing entities default to fully available for backward compatibility; new entities default to not available (secure by default).

- 11c0c77: **Extended role definitions and report ownership**

  Reinterpreted existing project roles without changing stored identifiers: Viewer becomes Business User with self-service reporting capabilities, Editor becomes Technical User with full technical maintenance access.
  - Business Users can now create, edit, delete, and run their own Reports and manage Report Triggers.
  - Business Users can also create, edit, and delete Destinations.
  - Technical Users retain project-wide Report management.
  - Implemented ineffective owner logic: if a Report owner loses access to the DataMart or Destination, they become read-only until access is restored.

- 004b9a5: **Invite teammates from setup screens**

  Added contextual "Invite teammates" helper blocks to setup and empty state screens. Includes a reusable component with responsive layout and optional documentation link.

- 0f07594: **Auto-select the only storage when creating a Data Mart**

  When creating a Data Mart, if the project has only one storage, that storage is now selected automatically.

- 870de85: **Geographic performance reports for Google Ads connector**

  Added `Geo Stats` and `Geo Target Constants` nodes to the Google Ads connector. The two tables are designed to be joined in BigQuery on `country_criterion_id`.

- 4033235: **X Ads: country breakdown for ad stats**

  Added `stats_by_country` node for daily ad stats broken down by country. A companion `targeting_locations` reference table maps X Ads location IDs to country names and ISO codes — join on the `country` field.

- 15390c6: **Progressive save for Facebook Ads data**

  Data is now saved to BigQuery page by page. A failure only affects the remaining pages, not the entire dataset.

- 126280a: # **Bug fixes and improvements**
  - 126280a: **Fixed empty error** text for invalid storage status — now shows "Access validation failed" instead of a blank space.
  - a848ac4: **Fixed Storage column sorting** on the Data Marts page — storages with custom names now sort correctly by their visible name.
  - 832bb73: **Error boundaries for unexpected application crashes**. Replaced the default React error screen with a user-friendly fallback UI. The sidebar stays visible for in-layout errors so users can navigate away without a full page reload.

### Minor Changes 0.22.0

![OWOX Data Marts – v0.22.0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dcd8ad37-7feb-4cc1-b8f8-a3309d9ee1c2)

- 4c9b96d: # **Business Owner & Technical Owner** for Data Marts

  Assign Business and Technical Owners to each Data Mart to track accountability and maintainability.
  - **Owners section** on the Data Mart edit page — assign one or more project members per role via an inline selector.
  - **Search and role display** — the member selector shows each user's project role with a search input for quick filtering.
  - **Outbound member warnings** — previously assigned owners who have been removed from the project are shown with a warning icon for easy reassignment.
  - **Business Owner and Technical Owner columns** in the Data Marts list table (hidden by default — enable via column settings).
  - **Filter by owner** in the Data Marts list to quickly find data marts by a specific team member.
  - **Auto-assigned Technical Owner** — the creator is automatically set as Technical Owner when a new Data Mart is created.

- b178723: # **Created By** visibility across major entities

  See who created each entity directly in the list views.
  - **Created By column** is now available in Data Storages, Data Destinations, Reports, Scheduled Triggers, and Insights tables.
  - **Filter by creator** is available in Data Destinations and Data Storages lists.

- 85abd92: # **Trigger-based execution** for connector and report runs

  Connector and report runs are now processed through a task queue instead of running immediately in the background. This improves reliability by ensuring runs are not lost on server restart, adds per-project concurrency limits, and automatically retries runs that cannot start due to concurrency limits. Includes a safety mechanism to detect and fail runs stuck in the queue for too long.

- 2406874: # **Onboarding video** for Email-based Reports

  A new onboarding video to improve adoption of Email-based Reports in Data Marts.
  - Shown once to new users on the **Destinations** tab in Data Mart.
  - Available in **Help menu → Video tutorials**.
  - Embedded in **Email Reports documentation**.

- 9395757: # **Sign In page** redesign with product-focused brand panel

  Redesigned the auth screen to better communicate product value and reduce sign-in friction.
  - **Brand panel** — replaced placeholder with a carousel of product use cases (Google Sheets, Looker Studio, Email delivery).
  - **Headline** — "Build once. Share anywhere." with outcome-driven copy and short supporting text per slide.
  - **Product preview** — visual workflows introduced directly on the auth screen.
  - **Carousel** — auto-rotation with lazy-loaded images.

- 737f292: # **Externalized connector secrets** from Data Mart definitions

  Non-OAuth secrets are moved from inline storage in Data Mart definitions to a separate `connector_source_credentials` table. Centralizes credential storage and reduces secret exposure in definition JSONs.
  - Added `_secrets_id` reference pattern (aligned with existing `_source_credential_id` for OAuth).
  - Secrets are extracted on save and injected during connector execution.
  - Includes data migration for existing Data Marts.

- a258b72: # **Improved UX for setting triggers**

  Reduced friction in the trigger setup flow: smart default type based on Data Mart configuration, improved empty state with a CTA button, and one-click schedule presets (Daily 9:00, Every hour, Every 6h, Weekdays 9:00).

- 2399254: # **Searchable Storage Selector** in Data Mart form

  The storage picker in the Create Data Mart form is upgraded to a searchable combobox.
  - Storages are listed in **alphabetical order** by title.
  - **Typeahead search** filters the list by typing — useful when many storages exist.
  - **Create new storage** option remains accessible at the bottom of the list.

- 62f435a: # **Auto-subscribe new project members** to notification settings

  New team members with Admin or Editor roles are automatically subscribed to existing notification settings when joining a project. Members who leave and rejoin are re-subscribed automatically. Manual unsubscribes are respected and not overridden. Members downgraded to Viewer are automatically removed from the receivers list.

- 6d53e58: # **Bug fixes and improvements**
  - **Connector definition validation** — fixed validators to allow early validation success; connector definitions no longer require credential validation during publish, resolving failures for Athena, BigQuery, Databricks, Redshift, and Snowflake.
  - **Delete confirmation dialog** — fixed undefined Data Mart title; dialog now correctly displays the actual data mart name.
  - **Edit button in oneOf config** — secret editing state is now tracked per-field, preventing unintended resets of sibling fields and auth type switches.

![OWOX Data Marts – v0.21.0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/01f4ddd8-5eb0-4407-8ba2-07dcc5cf9946)

- 7494cd6: # Introducing reusable **Insights with AI assistance**

  Insights is now available in OWOX! Use it to analyze your data mart results directly — create reports, explore your data, and share findings with your team. To get started, check out the [Insights setup guide](../../docs/getting-started/setup-guide/insights.md).

- a7bbb8c: # Add **OAuth for Google Ads** connector

  Added OAuth2 authentication flow for Google Ads connector. Users can now authorize access using a "Sign in with Google" button instead of manually entering RefreshToken, ClientId, and ClientSecret. The DeveloperToken is managed via environment variable and stored securely with other OAuth credentials. Also fixed a COOP SecurityError in the OAuth popup polling that affected all OAuth connectors.

- d906258: # Add **"Copy Credentials" button** to Storage and Destination

  Added a "Copy Credentials" button to Storage and Destination edit forms, allowing users to copy credential configuration from other storages or destinations of the same type. Includes new backend endpoints for listing storages and destinations by type with credential identity information.

- e68ca61: # **Improve Data Mart publish** status message

  The publish status message for data marts has been improved to provide more clarity and actionable information.
  - **Publish after:** The publish status message now shows what you need to do to publish the data mart. For example, if you need to complete storage configuration or configure an input source.
  - **Ready to publish:** The publish status message now shows that the data mart is ready to publish.

- cb57600: # Add **video tutorials** about completing storage setup and insights

  In the Help menu, we added two new video tutorials:
  - how to complete the Google BigQuery (used in OWOX extension) storage setup to publish Data Marts from OWOX Reports (Google Sheets extension)
  - how to get started with Insights

- 27e5af8: # **AWS Athena storage descriptions**

  Added support for column descriptions (comments) in AWS Athena storage and Output Schema.

- 90b7ee7: # Implement **destination name validation** for all data storage types

  Implements comprehensive destination name validation for `CONNECTOR` and `TABLE` definition types across BigQuery, Snowflake, Athena, Redshift, and Databricks. This update strengthens security by preventing malformed table names and ensuring all storage configurations are properly validated before processing.

- 1a7b5f8: # Improve form UI with **collapsible sections**

  This update introduces collapsible sections in forms to make configuration flows easier to complete. Less important or advanced settings can now be hidden by default, allowing users to focus on the most important fields first. For example, this approach can help when configuring storages that are automatically created during [integration](../../docs/getting-started/setup-guide/extension-data-marts.md) with the OWOX Reports extension for Google Sheets.

  The interaction follows the same collapsible pattern used in wizard screens, keeping the experience consistent across the product. Existing forms remain unchanged and continue to appear expanded by default.

- 6f1f61a: # Show **storage health status** in the configuration form

  This update improves visibility of the storage connection status when configuring a Data Storage. Users can now see whether the storage access is valid directly in the General section of the configuration form. This provides immediate feedback that the storage is correctly configured and ready to be used by Data Marts. This makes the setup experience clearer and helps users configure their storage with more confidence.

  **Benefits:**
  - Instantly understand if the storage connection is working
  - Quickly detect configuration issues
  - Maintain a consistent status indicator between the Data Storage list and the configuration form

- 7494cd6: # **Bug fixes and improvements**
  - Fix data storage validation for Google Legacy BigQuery connector
  - Fix missing dependencies for data destination and storage forms to avoid errors
  - Fix duplicate trigger runs caused by MySQL deadlocks not being handled as transient errors
  - Fix Google BigQuery storage not saving OAuth credentials and blocking OAuth-authenticated users from saving storage settings
  - Fix field descriptions and primary key flags being lost after schema sync in Redshift and Snowflake data marts

- cc5553d: # **New Sign Up options**: Email/Password and Microsoft Authentication in the Cloud edition on app.owox.com

  Users can now sign up using their email and password, or through Microsoft account integration for seamless access.

- 55ecd48: # **Table Filters** for Data Marts and Data Storages

  We’ve overhauled the table filtering experience to help you navigate large datasets with precision and speed:
  - Filter with logical conditions (Is / Is not / Contains / Does not contain)
  - Persistent filter states
  - Shareable, deep-linked views
  - At-a-glance status

- 800ec3c: # **Data table support** in email-based report templates

  You can now embed data mart results as a Markdown table in your email-based reports using the `{{table}}` tag with optional parameters.

- b88510a: # Add **Microsoft Ads OAuth** Integration
  - Implemented OAuth2 authentication flow for the Microsoft Ads connector to support secure, long-lived access.
  - Added frontend components (`MicrosoftLoginButton` and callback routing) to handle the user authorization process.
  - Updated the backend source configuration to parse and validate `AuthType` with Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token.
  - Implemented `exchangeOauthCredentials` and automatic token refreshing (`getAccessToken`) using the `offline_access` scope for persistent background data fetching.
  - Created database migrations to support storing the new `AuthType` JSON configuration for Microsoft Ads datamarts.

- 8b935a2: # **Google OAuth authentication** for BigQuery and Google Sheets

  BigQuery storages (including Legacy BigQuery) and Google Sheets destinations now support Google OAuth as an alternative to service account JSON. Users can connect their Google account directly via an OAuth button in the settings form and switch between authentication methods at any time.

- 01e6516: # Upgrade API Version in **Facebook Marketing Connector to v25.0**

  Updated all Facebook Graph API / Marketing API endpoints from `v23.0` to `v25.0` across the Facebook Marketing connector.

- 089e45b: # Facebook Marketing **API Page Limit**

  Added a user-configurable `Limit` parameter to the Facebook Marketing source to control API page size, helping resolve 'reduce the amount of data' errors for specific ad accounts.

- cc5553d: # **Adaptive input for SQL Query**

  The SQL Query block has been made more convenient for use on small screens. The ability to control the size of the block has been added.

- a03a952: # **TikTok Ads Country Dimension**

  Added `country_code` dimension to TikTok Ads connector with a new `ad_insights_by_country` node to support geographic breakdown in reporting.

- d141171: # Add data mart **link to Google Sheets metadata notes**

  Google Sheets exports now include a link to your data mart in the cell note (A1). The link takes you directly to the data mart page for quick access.

- aec648d: # **AWS Redshift Storage UI improvements**

  Moved the "Database Name" field after connection type selection to match the natural AWS Console lookup order.

- 9198b94: # **Sort runs in notification emails** by time (newest first)

  Previously, runs in notification emails appeared in the order they were added to the queue, which could result in non-chronological ordering (e.g., 2:48, 3:02, 3:03). Now runs are sorted by finished time in descending order, so the most recent runs appear first.

- c7cff50: # **Fix string timestamp** handling in Snowflake storage
  - Added support for ISO 8601 string values in TIMESTAMP and DATETIME columns
  - String timestamps are now parsed and formatted to `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` before being written to Snowflake
  - Invalid timestamp strings fall back to the existing special-character obfuscation path

- 2ab606c: # Add email and webhook notifications for Data Mart runs

  Add notification settings per project with support for email and webhook channels. Notifications are grouped by a configurable delay window and sent automatically when Data Mart runs fail or succeed. Settings are created automatically on the first run of a project.

- a23ec87: # Add batch publish action for draft data marts

  Add the ability to publish multiple draft data marts at once from the list page.

- 6e25a0a: # Add health status indicator for data storages

  Display a live access-validation indicator (colored dot with details on hover) for each configured data storage — both in the storages list and in the storage selector when creating a new data mart.

- 465891c: # Show data mart counts by status on the data storages list

  Show separate counts for published and draft data marts in the data storages list.

- 465891c: # Publish data storage drafts

  Add a publish drafts action for data storages with confirmation and result toasts.

- ee89c84: # Show actual error details when Google Sheets access check fails

  Previously, when Google Sheets API access validation failed, the error message always displayed a generic "Access check failed" text. Now the actual error message from the Google Sheets API is shown, making it easier to understand and fix the issue.

- ee89c84: # Add direct table link for AWS Redshift storages

  Add a direct link to the AWS Redshift Query Editor v2 console from the Data Mart's input source. After the clicking to the table name opens the SQL Workbench for the configured AWS region, similar to the existing console links for BigQuery, Athena, and Snowflake.

- 2f61b9b: # Fix Athena MaxResults exceeding API limit of 1000

  Cap `MaxResults` parameter to 1000 in Athena `getQueryResults` to comply with the AWS Athena API limit. Previously, callers could pass values greater than 1000 (e.g., streaming batch size of 5000), causing `InvalidRequestException` errors.

- ee89c84: # Fix LinkedIn Ads field type definitions
  - Fix `runSchedule` field in campaign schema: remove duplicate entry and set correct type to `OBJECT` instead of `NUMBER`

- 8298a39: # Improve Storage Creation UX and Interaction Safety

  The Storage creation flow is now smoother and more predictable.
  - Added click-lock protection to prevent accidental double-clicks when selecting a Storage type.
    This prevents duplicate creation requests and ensures users trigger the action only once.

  - `creative_object_story_spec` - Object story spec with page_id and other details
  - `creative_effective_object_story_id` - Page post ID used in the ad

- 66e494d: # **Fixed false error notification** about actualizing schema

  When configuring the Connector-based Data Mart, attempts to update the table schema would cause users to receive an error message in the UI that was not actually an error. For the Connector-based Data Mart, the table and schema are created on first run, so attempting to update the schema before the first run would result in an error in the UI. Now updating schema trigger checks the Data Mart type and doesn't try for these cases

- 061b00c: # Refactor connector execution architecture by removing the standalone `@owox/connector-runner` package and integrating its functionality directly into `@owox/connectors` package

  **⚠️ Breaking changes:**
  - Removed `@owox/connector-runner` package entirely

  **Changes:**
  - Removed `@kaciras/deasync` dependency
  - Removed `sync-request` dependency
  - Removed Google Apps Script support - Only Node.js environment is now supported
  - Refactored `EnvironmentAdapter` into specialized utility classes:
    - `HttpUtils` - HTTP requests
    - `DateUtils` - Date formatting
    - `AsyncUtils` - Async delays
    - `CryptoUtils` - Cryptographic operations
    - `FileUtils` - File parsing and decompression
  - Removed `ENVIRONMENT` enum and environment detection logic

  This helps you quickly understand where incremental loading will continue from and simplifies troubleshooting.

- f97c4e7: # Add new Facebook Marketing insights endpoints and improve Facebook field schema filtering

  Introduced several new **Facebook Marketing API insights** endpoints with specific breakdowns:
  - `ad-account/insights-by-age-and-gender` — provides age and gender breakdowns
  - `ad-account/insights-by-device-platform` — provides device platform breakdown
  - `ad-account/insights-by-product-id` — provides product ID breakdown
  - `ad-account/insights-by-publisher-platform` and
    `ad-account/insights-by-publisher-platform-and-position` — provide publisher platform and platform position breakdowns
  - `ad-account/insights-by-region` — provides region-level breakdown

  **⚠️ Breaking Changes**
  The legacy `ad-account/insights` endpoint **no longer supports breakdown fields**.

  If your Data Mart previously used `ad-account/insights` with breakdowns (such as `age`, `gender`, `country`, `device_platform`, `link_url_asset`, `product_id`, `publisher_platform`, `platform_position`, or `region`),
  please migrate to the appropriate new endpoint:

  | Breakdown Type                | New Endpoint                                             |
  | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
  | Age / Gender                  | `ad-account/insights-by-age-and-gender`                  |
  | Country                       | `ad-account/insights-by-country`                         |
  | Device Platform               | `ad-account/insights-by-device-platform`                 |
  | Link URL Asset                | `ad-account/insights-by-link-url-asset`                  |
  | Product ID                    | `ad-account/insights-by-product-id`                      |
  | Publisher Platform / Position | `ad-account/insights-by-publisher-platform-and-position` |
  | Region                        | `ad-account/insights-by-region`                          |

  ***

  **Recommendation:**
  ☝️ Recreate your Data Mart using the correct endpoint to ensure compatibility with the latest Facebook Marketing API structure.

  This fix ensures that boolean fields in connector configurations are properly handled, making them interactive and displaying appropriate UI indicators regardless of their default values.

- 6059657: # Fixed connector configuration fields editing

  Fixed an issue where connector configuration fields with default values were difficult to edit when setting up a data mart.
  Fields now properly handle user input and allow modification of default values.

- 7617b79: # Improved SQL validation flow in Data Marts to prevent timeout issues

  Previously, users were unable to save SQL queries in Data Marts when validation took longer than 30 seconds, causing timeout errors.

  This update resolves the issue by:
  - Made SQL validation asynchronous and non-blocking for saving SQL in Input Sources
  - SQL validation is no longer required for Publishing Data Marts

  Users can now save SQL queries regardless of validation time, improving the overall experience when working with complex queries or large datasets.

- 7617b79: # Fix messages for Data Mart publish button

  Improved the clarity of status messages displayed on the Data Mart publish button.
  You'll now see more accurate and informative feedback when publishing your Data Marts.

- f96f9aa: # Add Google Ads connector

  Added new Google Ads connector with Service Account authentication

  Available data nodes:
  - `campaigns`, `campaigns_stats` - Campaign data
  - `ad_groups`, `ad_groups_stats` - Ad group data
  - `ad_group_ads_stats` - Ad performance data
  - `keywords_stats` - Keyword performance data
  - `criterion` - Criteria data

- b11b726: # Added support for oneOf fields with recursive secret masking

  This release adds comprehensive support for oneOf configuration fields with nested secret handling. The connector secret service now recursively masks and merges secret fields within oneOf structures, ensuring sensitive data like API keys and tokens in nested authentication configurations are properly protected.

  New UI components include ButtonGroup for value-based selection and AppWizardCollapsible for expandable sections. Fixed an issue where the wrong oneOf variant was pre-selected when editing existing configurations.

  Added Advanced Fields section to the connector configuration form, allowing users to configure advanced settings for the connector.

- 1b97886: # Remove MaxFetchingDays parameter and improve incremental fetching logic

  Removed the `MaxFetchingDays` parameter from all data source connectors. The incremental data fetching now works as follows:
  - **First run (no state)**: Data fetching starts from the 1st of the previous month
  - **Subsequent runs**: Data is fetched from the `LastRequestedDate` (with `ReimportLookbackWindow` applied) up to today
  - **Manual backfill**: Continues to work as before, fetching data for the specified date range

  - Added `ad-account/insights-by-link-url-asset` endpoint with link_url_asset breakdown
  - Refactored insights data fetching to use object parameters and separate fields from breakdowns
  - **⚠️ Breaking Changes:** `ad-account/insights` endpoint no longer supports breakdown fields
  - **⚠️ Breaking Changes:** if your data mart was using `ad-account/insights` with breakdown fields (e.g., country, link_url_asset), you need to recreate it using the appropriate new endpoint:
    - Use `ad-account/insights-by-country` for country breakdown
    - Use `ad-account/insights-by-link-url-asset` for link URL asset breakdown

- 19c21a1: # ⚠️ Breaking Change: LinkedIn Authentication Update

  **What changed:**
  LinkedIn connectors now require **3 credentials** instead of 1 Access Token: Client ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token.

  **What you need to do:**
  1. Go to [LinkedIn Developer Portal](https://developer.linkedin.com/) → your app → **Auth** tab
  2. Copy these 3 values:
     - **Client ID** (top of Auth page)
     - **Client Secret** (top of Auth page)
     - **Refresh Token** (generate via OAuth 2.0 tools)

  **How to update:**
  1. Go to your OWOX Data Marts
  2. Find your LinkedIn connector configuration
  3. Enter the 3 new credentials instead of the old Access Token:
     - **Client ID**
     - **Client Secret**
     - **Refresh Token**

- b41b62d: # Logging System Architecture Refactor
  - **Refactored logging architecture**: Extracted Pino logger creation from LoggerFactory into a provider-agnostic architecture while maintaining backward compatibility

    - Updated `.env.example` with clear documentation
  - **Enhanced TypeORM integration**: Improved `CustomDataSourceLogger` with proper parameter usage and context formatting

  **Breaking Changes:**
  - `LOG_LEVELS` environment variable renamed to `LOG_LEVEL`
  - Removed `environment` field from `LoggerConfig` interface

  **Migration:**
  - Replace `LOG_LEVELS=log,warn,error` with `LOG_LEVEL=info` (threshold-based) or app will use default `info` level
  - Remove `environment` parameter from LoggerFactory calls

- 8a1ef12: # Secure MySQL connections (TLS/SSL)
  - New, simple way to enable encrypted MySQL connections via environment variables:
    - Backend (NestJS/TypeORM): `DB_SSL`
    - Identity provider (Better Auth): `IDP_BETTER_AUTH_MYSQL_SSL`

  - Improved reliability of loads/queries.
  - No action required — existing service account JSON keys continue to work.

- 58e2ead: # Updated Looker Studio data destination
  - Clarify `PUBLIC_ORIGIN`: base public URL of the application (scheme + host [+ optional port]).
    - Examples: `http://localhost:3000`, `https://data-marts.example.com`
    - Default: `http://localhost:${PORT}`
    - In production, set this to your actual deployment URL.
  - Introduce `LOOKER_STUDIO_DESTINATION_ORIGIN`: public origin used to generate the deployment URL for the Looker Studio destination.
    - If empty, it falls back to `PUBLIC_ORIGIN`.
    - Example: `https://looker.example.com`

  Heads up
  - When retrieving the current JSON config for a Looker Studio Data Destination, the `deploymentUrl` field is now generated from `LOOKER_STUDIO_DESTINATION_ORIGIN` (fallback: `PUBLIC_ORIGIN`). If you previously set `deploymentUrl` manually during creation, it is now populated from the environment variable values.

  - Unified form layout. All forms — for Triggers, Reports, Storage, and Destinations — now share a consistent design. This makes it easier to navigate and work with confidence.
  - Helpful hints where you need them. Tooltips and inline descriptions have been added next to form fields, so you can better understand what’s expected without second-guessing.
  - Improved tooltip styling. Tooltips now feature a more noticeable background, making important information easier to spot.
  - Faster editing. You can now enter edit mode in the Storage and Destinations tables with a single click on a row — no need to hunt for buttons.
  - Warnings before leaving with unsaved changes. If you make changes to a Storage or Destination and try to leave without saving, you’ll see a confirmation dialog — helping prevent accidental data loss.

  Refined Data Mart Page: Layout, Menu, and Texts
  - Updated the layout of the Connector block
  - Polished the dropdown menu on the Data Mart page

  Redesigned "Create Data Mart" Page
  - The form on the Create Data Mart page has been updated for visual consistency and a better user experience.

  Extra Visual and Text Tweaks
  - We’ve also made a few small improvements to the UI and copy to make everything feel more polished and cohesive.
